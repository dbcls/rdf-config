Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 5 to 10% of AML is associated with activating point mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), particularly at the D835 residue. FLT3 D835 mutations are a common mechanism of clinical resistance to type II FLT3 inhibitors (sorafenib, quizartinib and ponatinib), which bind only the inactive kinase conformation. However, gilteritinib, a type I oral inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL, demonstrated preclinical activity against type II FLT3 inhibitor resistance-conferring D835 mutations and clinical activity as monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated AML in multiple clinical trials.

The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic.eid:8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic.eid:8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic.eid:6930]. These pre-clinical and limited clinical studies show that ETV6-NTRK3 fusion-positive B-ALL may demonstrate response to larotrectinib with minimal adverse effects similar to solid tumors for which these are FDA-approved.	39	7993,8930,8917,7496,6099,8931,6930	2024-10-04 16:47:40 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8917,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7496,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6099,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8931,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false
