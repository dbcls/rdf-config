The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Capecitabine, bevacizumab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 190% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Seven mice experienced partial response and two experienced complete response. Triplet therapy resulted in better TGI and ILS compared to any agent in isolation or capecitabine + vemurafenib doublet therapy (p <0.05, p <0.0001, for all comparisons).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012		3	accepted	98	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/98	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false
BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012		2	accepted	99	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/99	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false
