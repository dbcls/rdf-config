The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Capecitabine, bevacizumab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 190% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Seven mice experienced partial response and two experienced complete response. Triplet therapy resulted in better TGI and ILS compared to any agent in isolation or capecitabine + vemurafenib doublet therapy (p <0.05, p <0.0001, for all comparisons).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012		3	accepted	98	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/98	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false
BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012		2	accepted	99	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/99	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false

BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. Of those, 30 patients harbored BRAF V600E, were KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=20), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=4), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 8 weeks (2-32 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (4-237 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 61 years old (42-78) and there were 16 males and 14 females. Authors concluded that BRAF mutation (23/24 of mutants were BRAF V600E) was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		3	accepted	126	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/126	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false

PIK3CA Exon 10 Mutation	106	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012		2	accepted	384	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/384	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/106	false

EGFR T790M	34	Lung Cancer	1324		Gefitinib,Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788	Sequential	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	PubMed		Yun et al., 2008		5	accepted	642	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/642	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/34	false

KIT Exon 11 Mutation	66	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective study of 127 pretreatment patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). 85 patients harbored KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs: 71 had an in-frame deletion and 15 had unspecified point mutations (3 codon 557 cases, 3 codon 559 cases, 6 codon 560 cases and 2 codon 576 cases). Of patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs, 71 (83.5%) had a partial response, 7 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 3 were nonassessable. Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006) or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85). Patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 687 days) than those with KIT exon 9 mutant or double WT kinase GISTs (200 days and 82 days, respectively). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 11 mutant KIT had improved overall survival compared to patients whose tumor expressed an exon 9 mutant KIT (P = .0034) or double WT kinases (P <.0001).	14645423	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2003		4	accepted	654	Somatic	2023-03-02 22:34:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/654	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/66	false

EML4::ALK Fusion AND ALK G1269A	4312	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Resistance	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.	22235099	PubMed		Doebele et al., 2012		4	accepted	764	Somatic	2023-02-21 23:35:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/764	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4312	false

Of 17 patients with BRAF V600E melanoma, 4 achieved partial response, 5 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks, and 8 experienced disease progression (including 2 with prior vemurafenib treatment). One of the partial responders had a concomitant EGFR mutation, and two of the stable disease patients had other concomitant mutations (in RET or MET). The median days on treatment was 113 (18-366) for BRAF V600E melanoma patients and 107 (17-323) for BRAF V600 wildtype patients (n=23). Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma experienced similar response rates (24% vs 20%) and rates of metabolic response measured by decrease in FDG uptake assessed by FDG-PET (86% vs 75%) compared to non-BRAF mutant patients. Patients with melanoma, either BRAF wt or V600E, experienced significant decreases in Ki67 expression by day 15 of MEK inhibitor treatment (P<0.02).

KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		MEK Inhibitor RO4987655		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Resistance	This was a phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655 on advanced cancer. Of 18 patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 experienced clinical benefit: 2 partial responses and 8 patients experiencing stable disease for longer than 8 weeks. The median days on treatment was 58.5 (13-394) with one patient ongoing treatment at the end of the study period (56 weeks). The response rate of patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC was 11%, and 71% showed decrease in metabolic response (less FDG uptake in FDG-PET analysis). All responders showed decreases in FDG-uptake. There was not a significant decrease in Ki67 expression between day 1 and day 15 of treatment. Authors conclude that RO4987655 has some clinical activity in KRAS mutated NSCLC, though patients with KRAS wild-type NSCLC were excluded from this expansion study, so it is not possible to determine whether activity of RO4987655 in NSCLC is related to KRAS mutation status.	24947927	PubMed		Zimmer et al., 2014		3	accepted	997	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/997	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false

In this randomized 3 arm phase II study (CHER-LOB), patients received (A) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, (B) chemotherapy plus lapatinib, or (C) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, with pathologic complete response (pCR) as endpoint. From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C. The authors conclude these results support the superiority of dual-HER2 inhibition in the neoadjuvant context of HER2 positive BC.	22493419	PubMed		Guarneri et al., 2012		4	accepted	1007	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1007	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Lapatinib,Trastuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III trial compared the activity of lapatinib vs. trastuzumab vs. sequential trastuzumab followed by lapatinib vs. lapatinib plus trastuzumab in an adjuvant treatment setting. 8381 women were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Patients had HER2 positive non-metastatic operable BC. The primary endpoint was disease free survival. First results report that after median 4.5 year follow up, a non significant 16% improvement in DFS was seen in trastuzumab + lapatinib vs. trastuzumab alone. The results are interpreted as showing no added benefit for labatinib addition to trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment context. This trial is ongoing but not recruiting patients (NCT00490139).	26255196	PubMed		Zardavas et al., 2015		4	accepted	1008	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1008	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Lapatinib,Trastuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This Phase III study (EGF104900) was motivated by preclinical and other data demonstrating synergistic activity between lapatinib and trastuzumab against HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) cells. In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008). The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.	20124187	PubMed		Blackwell et al., 2010		4	accepted	1009	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1009	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

Benefit was seen in 30% of 40 patients assigned to afatinib alone, 34.2% of 38 assigned to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 41.9% of 43 assigned to investigator's treatment choice. Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects. While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned.	26596672	PubMed		Cortés et al., 2015	NCT01441596	3	accepted	1011	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1011	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Afatinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	LUX-Breast 1 is a phase 3 trial (NCT01125566) which enrolled 508 patients with metastatic HER2 positive BC who had progressed after adjuvant or first-line trastuzumab. It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169 to trastuzumab + vinorelbine. Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group. Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	26822398	PubMed		Harbeck et al., 2016	NCT01125566	4	accepted	1012	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1012	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Afatinib,Trastuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers. The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC. Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%. The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.	25370464	PubMed		Ring et al., 2015		3	accepted	1013	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1013	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

HER2 positivity was broadly defined as IHC2+/3+, positive by FISH, or increased circulating HER2 extracellular domain. Significant differences between the treatment arms were not observed, but in a small subset of IHC3+/FISH positive patients, 5 of 6 responded to trastuzumab and had increased PFS of 8.5 months in comparison to 6.1 months in the IHC2+ group. Although from 2004, this study remains cited in 2016 literature when discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC. The authors conclude that future studies of trastuzumab in HER2 positive NSCLC should focus on high expressing subjects.	14679114	PubMed		Gatzemeier et al., 2004		2	accepted	1041	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1041	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

The authors report that due to the limited clinical activity of trastuzumab-based therapy in this cohort, as well as similar results in other trastuzumab studies, that targets other than HER2 in NSCLC should be considered for future study. This 2004 study remains cited in 2016 literature in discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC, but mutant HER2 in NSCLC has been further studied and a picture of different HER2 mutations being potentially responsive to specific targeted therapies is emerging.	14967075	PubMed		Lara et al., 2004		3	accepted	1042	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1042	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Kinase Domain Mutation	409	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910		Trastuzumab		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC who had undergone varied courses of treatment. All tumors were adenocarcinoma with in-frame HER2 exon 20 insertions. In patients (n=57) that had been treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, an overall response rate of 75% and progression free survival of 5.1 months were observed. No standard of care currently exists for HER2-mutant NSCLC. While trastuzumab has not shown clear benefit yet in wild-type HER2 overexpressed NSCLC, the authors conclude that further prospective studies should be done with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in advanced HER2 mutant NSCLC, and that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy should be considered in current treatment courses of this cancer type.	26598547	PubMed		Mazières et al., 2016		4	accepted	1043	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1043	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/409	false

In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment. With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months. Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC. Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation. Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months. While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.	25601188	PubMed		Kinehara et al., 2015		4	accepted	1044	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1044	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline. Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression. Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab.	19122144	PubMed		Perera et al., 2009		4	accepted	1047	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1047	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/410	false

In vitro analysis in the murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 with ectopic expression of EGFR mutations S492R, R451C, K467T, and G465R showed that Sym004 effectively bound to all mutants, whereas cetuximab and panitumumab did not effectively bind to all mutants. In-vitro, Sym004 inhibited growth of S492R and G465R EGFR mutant cell lines. In-vivo analysis of S492R and G465R mutant cell lines showed regression of S492R and tumor growth delay of G465R mutant cell lines. G465R mutant cell lines were resistant to treatment with panitumumab or cetuximab in-vitro.	26888827	PubMed		Sánchez-Martín et al., 2016		4	accepted	1058	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1058	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/439	false
NEDD9 EXPRESSION	440	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	684				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	IHC was performed in 123 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal liver tissues for protein expression of HEF1 (NEDD9). Overexpression of HEF1 protein was observed in HCC tissue when compared with their adjacent non-malignant liver tissue. High expression of HEF1 correlated with higher advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion (P<0.05). In univariate and multivariate analysis, the expression of HEF1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor (Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression model). In subgroup analysis, high expression of HEF1 correlated with a poorer prognosis in advanced (TNM III+IV) stages (P<0.05).	26893853	PubMed		Li et al., 2016		3	accepted	1059	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1059	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/440	false

FGF13 CYTOPLASMIC EXPRESSION	443	Prostate Cancer	10283				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	243 primary PCa, 37 metastatic PCa, and 20 castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) specimens underwent IHC and microarray analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that FGF13 was detectable in the majority of human PCa samples, and FGF13 IHC scores were higher in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, in primary PCa, and in metastatic PCa than in benign prostatic tissue. There was a significant association between high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining and a risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining was associated with BCR. Results were recapitulated in cell lines and public databases.	26891277	PubMed		Yu et al., 2016		3	accepted	1062	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1062	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/443	false

SS18::SSX1 Fusion	444	Synovial Sarcoma	5485				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this review, the author summarize the role of this fusion in diagnosis of synovial sarcomas. Cytogenetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated the t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation in approximately 90% of both monophasic and biphasic synovial sarcomas. The fusion has clear diagnostic value, though the authors caution that it is not perfectly specific to synovial sarcomas, and suggest that demonstration of t(X;18) in a spindle cell neoplasm should be integrated with the morphology, immunoprofile, and clinical setting of the tumour.	11122430	PubMed		Pfeifer et al., 2000		4	accepted	1069	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1069	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/444	false

ERBB2 Amplification	302	Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma	5750				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In a study of 27 African American and caucasian patients, endometrial adenocarcinoma samples were assessed for HER2 via IHC staining, and association studies were performed using corresponding patient information. Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression. Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients. The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.	15746676	PubMed		Santin et al., 2005		4	accepted	1096	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1096	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women. This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH. Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL. The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation. Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered. After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL. The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.	18555254	PubMed		Santin et al., 2008		4	accepted	1097	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1097	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Endometrial Cancer	1380		Trastuzumab		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint. Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer. During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status. In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted. The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study. 28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies. The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study. Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.	19840887	PubMed		Fleming et al., 2010		2	accepted	1098	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1098	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

NPM1 EXON 11 MUTATION	86	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Peripheral blood from NPM1 mutated AMLs was assessed for NPM1 mutation status at multiple time points using RT-qPCR with primers designed to amplify different mutant NPM1 transcripts. The test development cohort consisted of 194 cases and an independent validation cohort consisted of 91 cases. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts.	26789727	PubMed		Ivey et al., 2016		4	accepted	1102	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1102	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/86	false
CEBPA N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	28	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		OICR-9429		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.	26167872	PubMed		Grebien et al., 2015		3	accepted	1103	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1103	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/28	false

Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.	23934108	PubMed		Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013		3	accepted	1140	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1140	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false

A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy.	24685132	PubMed		Sun et al., 2014		3	accepted	1152	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1152	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/285	false

Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane. This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physician's choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198). Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physician's choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1.

KRAS G12C	78	Cancer	162		ARS-853,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study to investigate mechanisms of KRAS G12C activity and inhibition with ARS-853, a covalent (irreversible) inhibitor which binds KRAS G12C in the GDP-bound state to prevent activation. Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay. Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	26739882	PubMed		Patricelli et al., 2016		3	accepted	1173	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1173	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/78	false

Cell viability was evaluated following knockdown of 834 genes in isogenic LIM1215 colorectal cancer cell lines harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D or G12V KRAS. 6 targets identified by this screen were evaluated in a second set of isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines (SW48) harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D, G12V or G13D KRAS where only CDK1 knockdown more profoundly reduced survival in mutant cells compared to wildtype. Results were validated in 5 KRAS mutant (BRAF WT) and 10 KRAS WT colorectal cancer cell lines. Chemical inhibition of CDK1 by AZD5438 in KRAS mutant vs WT pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines showed increased efficacy in mutant cell lines. Finally, AZD5438 reduced tumor growth induced by SW620 (KRAS p.G12V) colorectal tumour cells xenografted into immunodeficient mice.	26881434	PubMed		Costa-Cabral et al., 2016		3	accepted	1183	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1183	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false

Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010	NCT00585195	5	accepted	1187	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1187	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false
EML4::ALK Fusion	5	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		WHI-P154		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci. Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation. BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC, and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	PubMed		Soda et al., 2007		5	accepted	1188	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1188	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5	false

This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010	NCT00585195	2	accepted	1189	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1189	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/496	false
EML4::ALK e2::e20	497	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	E	Sensitivity/Response	Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing. 5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not. These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.	18927303	PubMed		Takeuchi et al., 2008		4	accepted	1190	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1190	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/497	false

NGS revealed a frameshift mutation in APC, a missense mutation in KRAS. Variants of uncertain significance were: a missense variant in ERBB2 and a missense variant in KDR at amino acid 961 converting the wild type residue, Arginine, to Tryptophan (frequency 28.25%). Because of the high frequency of the KDR (VEGFR2) mutation, the patient was considered a suitable candidate for a VEGFR inhibitor and received regorafenib monotherapy, which is approved for this situation, at 80mg daily which was later reduced to 40mg daily and had CEA normalization as well as partial metabolic and radiologic response. The patient remained almost asymptomatic and without disease progression after 39 weeks.	27004155	PubMed		Loaiza-Bonilla et al., 2016		1	accepted	1191	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1191	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/498	false

Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20. 3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice. The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line. The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.	18593892	PubMed		Choi et al., 2008		4	accepted	1192	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1192	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/499	false

Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant. Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31. In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease. These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010	NCT00585195	4	accepted	1193	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1193	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/499	false

Of these, NCI-H2228 harbored EML4-ALK variant 3a/b (EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20). TAE684 inhibited Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in H2228 cells and appeared to induce a cytostatic response.	18451166	PubMed		McDermott et al., 2008		2	accepted	1194	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1194	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/499	false

TAE684 (0.1uM) appreciably inhibited growth as well as Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in variant 1 containing H3122 cells. However, incomplete inhibition in 3a/3b containing H2228 cells was observed. H2228 growth inhibition by TAE684 was more similar to NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and EGFR mutations.	18594010	PubMed		Koivunen et al., 2008		2	accepted	1195	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1195	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/499	false

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate. While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity. Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012		2	accepted	1196	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1196	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/496	false

Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition. EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012		2	accepted	1204	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1204	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/496	false

This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010	NCT00585195	4	accepted	1207	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1207	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5	false
KRAS Exon 2 Mutation	75	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	102 mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy were analyzed for 34 hotspot mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF with nanofluidic digital PCR and quantitative PCR. dPCR and qPCR results were correlated to PFS and OS. Analysis of only KRAS exon 2 hotspot mutations showed that patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 19/83) had a hazard ratio of 3.43 for PFS (95% CI, 1.67–7.02; P=0.002) and 2.72 for OS (95% CI, 1.52–4.88; P=0.002) compared to wild-type patients or patients with less than 1% mutant allele fraction. Considering all RAS and BRAF mutations, the patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 37/65) had a hazard ratio of 4.52 for PFS (95% CI, 2.25–9.07; P<0.001) and 2.5 for OS (95% CI, 1.57–4.02; P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off of 1% for any mutated allele offered the best predictive value.	27037411	PubMed		Azuara et al., 2016		3	accepted	1208	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1208	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/75	false
TP53 P47S	500	Cancer	162		Cisplatin		Predictive	Supports	E	Resistance	The P47S (rs1800371) variant of TP53 is observed in 1.5% in African Americans and between 6% and 8% in certain African populations but has not been detected in Caucasian Americans. This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).	27034505	PubMed		Jennis et al., 2016		2	accepted	1209	Common Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1209	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/500	false

Both tumors harbored TP53 mutations and lack of MGMT promoter hypermethylation as poor prognostic markers. Germline homozygous c.2117delA, p. Lys706SerfsX19 mutation in PMS2, loss of PMS2 staining in the tumor and normal tissue confirmed a diagnosis of biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD). Both tumors harbored driver mutations in POLE and were found to harbor 24,680 and 21,919 mutations per exome. Neoantigen load was assessed in 37 bMMRD patients and all malignant tumors had high numbers of predicted neoantigens (7-16x as high as in melanoma, lung or other immunoresponsive cancers).

Of 114 NSCLC patients treated with at least 400 mg/daily ceritinib, 1 had a complete response, 65 had a partial response, 25 had stable disease, 12 had progressive disease, and 11 withdrew from the study early. Ceritinib dosed at 400 mg or higher had similar results in patients who had or had not received prior crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate for patients with prior crizotinib treatment (83 out of 122) was 56% with median progression free survival of 6.9 months. For patients who had no prior crizotinib treatment, median progression free survival was 10.4 months.	24670165	PubMed		Shaw et al., 2014	NCT01283516	4	accepted	1237	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1237	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/508	false

In this study, targeted activity against NPM-ALK by the ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib was assessed in cell lines and tumor xenograft models. Treatment of NPM-ALK positive ALCL cell lines Karpas299 and SU-DHL-1 potently inhibited growth, and this was seen to occur at concentrations which also inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in these cells. Administration of 100mg/kg/d crizotinib resulted in complete regression of all tumors, indicating that NPM-ALK could be an effective target for crizotinib in ALCL.	18089725	PubMed		Christensen et al., 2007		5	accepted	1239	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1239	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/509	false

Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive). The authors conclude these two cases indicate sensitivity to crizotinib of relapsed ALK-rearranged ALCL.	21345110	PubMed		Gambacorti-Passerini et al., 2011		4	accepted	1240	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1240	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false

In a retrospective study of 38 patients with ALK-rearranged DLBCL, 3 were CD20 positive. Only one showed cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar staining associated with NPM-ALK, while the others showed granular cytoplasmic ALK stain characteristic for CLTC-ALK. Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK. 6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group. Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.	19636007	PubMed		Laurent et al., 2009		3	accepted	1263	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1263	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/516	false

ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL.	24330038	PubMed		Wass et al., 2014		2	accepted	1264	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1264	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false
CLTC::ALK Fusion	516	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 21 year old male presented with lymphadenopathy and a low density mass in pancreas. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.	26221234	PubMed		Li et al., 2015		3	accepted	1265	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1265	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/516	false

ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	23639470	PubMed		Seto et al., 2013		3	accepted	1272	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1272	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false

Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.	26938871	PubMed		Yoshida et al., 2016		3	accepted	1273	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1273	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false

DUX4::v Fusion	520	Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	9952				Diagnostic	Supports	D	Positive	A screen for fusion genes in Ph- AYA-ALL (Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults) was performed using RNA-seq from multiple cohorts of ALL patients. DUX4, ZNF384 and MEF2D fusions were the most frequent found. DUX4 fusions were found only in AYA cases (age 15-39) and this was significant, p=0.016. DUX4 fusions clustered into groups distinct from the other fusions, and these fusions as a whole clustered with Ph- ALL cases. The authors performed extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate that DUX4 fusions are likely early initiating/events and that DUX4 fusion and not DUX4 wild type are tumorigenic. The authors conclude that DUX4 fusions may be a target driver resulting in AYA-ALL, and that AYA-ALL may be a distinct clinical entity.	27019113	PubMed		Yasuda et al., 2016		4	accepted	1276	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1276	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/520	false

ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.	25153538	PubMed		Gadgeel et al., 2014	NCT01588028	4	accepted	1279	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1279	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false

A structural variation in BIM2 (BCL2L11) with an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion was identified in all three resistant samples. 2,597 healthy individuals were screened and the deletion polymorphism was identified in 12.3% of East Asian Population but 0% in African or European Population. In-vitro, imatinib-induced apoptosis was reduced in cells harboring the BIM deletion polymorphism. Two East Asian CML cohorts (n=203) treated with imatinib were analzed for the polymorphism. Overall odds ratio for resistant disease among subjects with the deletion polymorphism compared to those without it was 2.94 (P = 0.02, 95% CI 1.17–7.43). Patients with the polymorphism, compared to those without, were more likely to be resistant without BCR-ABL mutations than resistant with BCR-ABL mutation or sensitive (odds ratio = 1.90, 95% CI 1.08–4.35).	22426421	PubMed		Ng et al., 2012		4	accepted	1280	Common Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1280	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/522	false

Introduction of this polymorphism in a previously EGFR-inhibitor sensitive cell line led to TKI-resistance. In 141 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the presence of the polymorphism (N=26) was predictive of a significantly shorter PFS under treatment with EGFR-TKI (6.6 months vs. 11.9 months, p = 0.0027).

The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		4	accepted	1283	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1283	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/523	false

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		4	accepted	1284	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1284	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/523	false

The ALK kinase domain mutation V1180L was found in these cells, and Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK V1180L were highly resistant to alectinib. Simulations indicated that the V1180L mutation interfered with alectinib binding. The V1180L mutation was found to be more resistant to alectinib than the I1171T mutation found in an ALK-positive NSCLC patient who developed alectinib resistance on lower dose alectinib (300mg twice daily).	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		3	accepted	1286	Somatic	2023-03-10 00:51:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1286	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4351	false

Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered Ba/F3 cells moderately less susceptible to crizotinib than ectopic EML4-ALK.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		2	accepted	1288	Somatic	2023-03-10 00:52:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1288	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4351	false

A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		3	accepted	1289	Somatic	2023-03-10 00:51:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1289	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4351	false

This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		3	accepted	1290	Somatic	2023-03-10 00:51:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1290	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4351	false

The IC50 for brigatinib against EML4-ALK wild-type was 0.95, which is about 3x higher than the IC50 that was observed for alectinib, but about 6x lower than that for crizotinib. In contrast, the IC50 for brigatinib against the alectinib resistance variant EML4-ALK V1180L was 0.49, indicating increased sensitivity to brigatinib over non mutant EML4-ALK.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014		2	accepted	1291	Somatic	2023-03-10 00:52:22 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1291	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4351	false
ATM Underexpression	179	Pancreatic Cancer	1793				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Absent expression of ATM, as assessed by IHC in 133 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, was found to be associated with dismal prognosis (median survival, 9.6 months), whereas expression of ATM was associated with increased survival (17.7 months, P = 0.001). Furthermore loss of expression of nuclear phosphorylated Ser1981-ATM (IHC) was indicative of the worst prognosis (median survival, 10.8 vs 14.3 months [low expression] vs 31.1 months [high expression], P < 0.001).	25423555	PubMed		Kamphues et al., 2015		2	accepted	1292	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1292	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/179	false

SIRT1 Overexpression	525	Pancreatic Cancer	1793		Niacinamide		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	In-vitro study with MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Sirt1 by increasing concentrations of nicotinamide led to a decrease in viability. Gefitinib treatment with concentrations of 50 μM showed similar effects as observed for the application of 25 mM nicotinamide. Combinatory treatment with gefitinib and nicotinamide showed a synergistic effect on cell viability. In cell lines overexpressing Sirt1, higher concentrations of nicotinamide were required to abrogate increased cell viability mediated by Sirt1 overexpression compared to controls.	24088390	PubMed		Stenzinger et al., 2013		1	accepted	1294	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1294	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/525	false

v::ROS1 Fusion	2562	Colorectal Adenocarcinoma	0050861		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	E	Sensitivity/Response	A tissue microarray of 268 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma was performed to search for ROS1 gene fusion events to guide potential targeted therapy in future cases. Break apart FISH assay, which does not distinguish ROS1-fusion partner, was used on the tissue microarray to determine ROS1 fusion status. 2 cases of ROS1 fusions were found. 1 case was verified by RT-PCR to be a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, but this case was also positive for BRAF V600E. The second case of ROS1 fusion was of undetermined fusion partner, where known ROS1 fusion parters SLC34A2, CD74 and SDC4 were tested. This case did not have KRAS or BRAF mutations, indicating that ROS1 fusion may act in a small subset of colorectal cancer as a driver targetable by crizotinib or other inhibitors.	24296758	PubMed		Aisner et al., 2014		2	accepted	1301	Somatic	2024-08-27 23:16:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1301	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2562	false

These cells were more sensitive than other neuroblastoma cell lines containing wild-type ALK. Marked inhibition of soft agar colony formation of SH-SY5Y cells was also observed with drug treatment. AZD3463 inhibited Akt signaling in these cells within two hours of treatment, and activated apoptosis and autophagy pathways. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells implanted into left kidneys of nude mice resulted in almost complete tumor regression.	26786851	PubMed		Wang et al., 2016		3	accepted	1327	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1327	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/8	false

COG-N-453x and SH-SY5Y xenografts showed some inhibition when treated with crizotinib, but showed complete growth inhibition with PF-06463922 treatment. This corresponded to 0% event free survival (EFS) in these mice by 6 weeks with crizotinib treatment, but 100% EFS with PF-06463922 treatment. Comparison of crizotinib and PF-06463922 growth inhibition in F1174L cells SH-SY5Y, NBSD 415-IMDM and KELLY showed increased sensitivity to PF-06463922, as compared to crizotinib. Inhibition effects were not seen on neuroblastoma cells with wild type ALK (NB-EBc1, SK-N-BE(2)C). Decreased phosphorylation on ALK tyrosine 1278 was seen with PF-06463922 over crizotinib at 10 and 100 nM concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells.

Cells were subsequently cultured in 96 well plates at increasing concentrations of crizotinib (250, 500, 720, 1000, 1440 and 2000 nM). Cell growth occurred in all wells at 250 nM, and was absent at 2000 nM. From 500 through 1440 nM there were progressively fewer resistant clones present. 422 mutations representing 16 different sites were identified. EML4-ALK F1245C was found at 500 nM crizotinib, and was among the 10 most frequently observed mutations. Ba/F3 cells with unaltered EML4-ALK had crizotinib IC50 values for viability of 132 +/- 45 nM. EML4-ALK F1245C clones from the selection assay had IC50 viability value of 425 +/- 100 nM, while Ba/F3 cells expressing reintroduced EML4-ALK F1245C had IC50 value of 269 +/- 194 nM.	22034911	PubMed		Zhang et al., 2011		2	accepted	1337	Somatic	2023-02-01 20:59:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1337	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4221	false

He tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, and started crizotinib with near complete response for 27 months. Progression then occurred and biopsy of a pleural nodule was performed with hybrid-capture NGS. EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation was found with allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity 13%. Due to slow progression and low tumor burden crizotinib was maintained for additional 8 months, and then he was transitioned onto ceritinib at 750 mg daily. After 3 months ceritinib, complete radiographic response was seen and the patient was without evidence of disease at 6 months. Dose was reduced to 600 mg ceritinib daily due to gastrointestinal side effects.	26775591	PubMed		Kodityal et al., 2016		3	accepted	1338	Somatic	2023-02-01 21:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1338	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4221	false

Upon disease progression, the initial diagnostic biopsy tested positive for ALK-rearrangement using break apart FISH, but the ALK fusion was not sequenced for mutations. Break-apart signal was positive in 66% of tumor cells. Crizotinib was initiated and a sustained near complete response for 27 months was observed, after which an FDG-avid cervical lymph node appeared along with pleural effusions and pleural nodules. A pleural nodule was biopsied and profiled using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing, and revealed EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation at mutant allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity of 13%.

SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans.	24675041	PubMed		Friboulet et al., 2014		3	accepted	1340	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1340	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/499	false

Similar experiments using NPM-ALK instead of EML4-ALK yielded survival IC50 of 549 nM of NPM-ALK G1202R to alectinib, which was 27.9 times higher than IC50 for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of Ba/F3 with NPM-ALK wild-type showed ablation of pALK levels above 100 nM alectinib, while pALK levels were essentially unchanged up to 1000 nM in NPM-ALK G1202R Ba/F3 cells.	25727400	PubMed		Fontana et al., 2015		3	accepted	1350	Somatic	2023-02-01 21:21:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1350	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4237	false
EML4::ALK Fusion AND ALK G1202R	4237	Cancer	162		Brigatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	This study compared drug responses in Ba/F3 cells expressing either EML4-ALK or NPM-ALK fusions, with or without G1202R ALK mutation. Cells expressing the EML4-ALK variant 3 with G1202R ALK mutation were more resistant to brigatinib treatment (IC50 325 nM) than cells expressing wildtype EML4-ALK variant 3 (IC50 6 nM). These same experiments performed with the NPM-ALK fusion resulted in IC50 of 149 nM for G1202R and 11nM for wild type, consistent with resistance. In Western blots, ablation of pALK with brigatinib treatment above 100 nM was seen in Ba/F3 cells expressing NPM-ALK wildtype, but remained apparent at 1000 nM brigatinib in NPM-ALK G1202R cells, despite dose-dependent reduction.	25727400	PubMed		Fontana et al., 2015		3	accepted	1351	Somatic	2023-02-01 21:22:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1351	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4237	false

EML4-ALK variant 1 with G1202R mutation was expressed in Ba/F3 and subject to 17-AAG. IC50 for cell number in response to 17-AAG was 33.4 nM, in contrast to IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, which was 98.9 nM, suggesting sensitization of this variant to HSP90 inhibition.	22277784	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2012		2	accepted	1352	Somatic	2023-02-01 21:24:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1352	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4237	false

NPM-ALK G1269A was also tested for brigatinib sensitivity, and IC50 values of 11 nM were reported for both NPM-ALK G1269A and NPM-ALK wild-type. In western blotting, brigatinib at and above 100 nM ablated pALK signal (Y 1604), indicating sensitivity of this variant to brigatinib together with the other results.	25727400	PubMed		Fontana et al., 2015		2	accepted	1353	Somatic	2023-03-03 00:21:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1353	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4311	false
ALK G1269A AND v::ALK Fusion	4311	Cancer	162		Alectinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	EML4-ALK with ALK G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to alectinib using Ba/F3 cells. In Ba/F3 cells with ectopic EML4-ALK variant 1 G1269A, IC50 of 84 nM was reported with alectinib, which was a 6 fold increase over IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type. The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM. In contrast pALK signal was ablated at and above 100 nM in NPM-ALK wild-type.	25727400	PubMed		Fontana et al., 2015		3	accepted	1354	Somatic	2023-03-03 00:21:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1354	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4311	false

IC50 of 33 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating sensitivity of the G1269A mutation to ceritinib in the context of EML4-ALK. The mutation was also tested for ceritinib sensitivity in the context of NPM-ALK, where IC50 values were reported of 19 nM and 20 nM for mutant and wild-type versions, respectively, also indicating sensitivity. In western blots, Y1604 pALK levels for wild-type NPM-ALK were ablated at 100 nM, while at 100 nM residual pALK levels were seen in G1269A blotting, with ablation of signal at and above 300 nM, which differed somewhat from the equivalent IC50 values reported for mutant and wild-type in the NPM-ALK background, but still agrees with sensitivity to ceritinib for this mutation.	25727400	PubMed		Fontana et al., 2015		2	accepted	1355	Somatic	2023-03-03 00:21:57 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1355	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4311	false

ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Pictilisib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	The HER2/Neu mammary tumor mouse model MMTV-NeuT was employed to demonstrate dependence of HER2 tumor formation on PIK3 p110alpha isoform. MMTV-NeuT mice were crossed with floxed p110alpha mice. Diassacociated tumors cells from these mice were treated with Cre adenovirus to delete p110alpha, or GFP adenovirus, and cells were transplanted into athymic mice. GFP treated cells formed new tumors, while p110alpha deletion blocked tumor formation indicating tumor dependence on PI3KA. Next, MMTV-NeuT tumors were dissociated and treated with pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Reduced lipid kinase activity and reduced phospho-Akt levels were seen in these cells. Administration of 125 mg/kg GDC-0941 to athymic mice with transplantation of tumor cells caused marked reduction of tumor cell volume in comparison to control treatment.	22802530	PubMed		Utermark et al., 2012		3	accepted	1380	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1380	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

MET Overexpression	617	Skin Melanoma	8923		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	Whole exome sequencing, transcriptome and methylome alterations in 48 melanoma samples with acquired resistance to BRAFi +/- MEKi therapy compared to patient-matched baseline melanoma tissues were analyzed. 39% of resistant melanomas were not accounted for by any validated mutational mechanism. c-MET was overexpressed in 21 of 48 (44%) resistant samples. Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients. In two human BRAF V600E mutant cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to progressive methylation-expression changes akin to observations across MAPKi-sensitive versus resistant tumors.	26359985	PubMed		Hugo et al., 2015		4	accepted	1581	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1581	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/617	false
MET Overexpression	617	Uveal Melanoma	6039		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	c-MET and ligand HGF were expressed by 6 uveal melanoma cell lines in-vitro. GNA-mutant cell lines (n=3) showed stronger expression of ligand and receptor as well as more receptor phosphorylation. SiRNA mediated MET-knockdown reduced cell migration but not cell growth. Crizotinib treatment led to a decrease in cell growth and migration. At 25 nmol/L of crizotinib, only the migration of G-protein mutant cells lines and not G-protein wild type cell lines was decreased. Crizotinib did not lead to a reduction in tumor volume of two cell lines in vivo but reduced the formation of macrometastases (luciferase activity, p=0.03).	24140933	PubMed		Surriga et al., 2013		1	accepted	1583	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1583	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/617	false

PIK3R1 Mutation	629	Breast Cancer	1612		MTOR Kinase Inhibitor PP242		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Sensitivity to mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242 was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with various mutation backgrounds. PTEN and PIK3CA mutations were heavily represented in the panel. However, a PTEN and PIK3CA wild type cell line 'HS578T' was found to harbor a mutation in the PI3K regulatory protein PIK3R1. Like PIK3CA mutant cell lines, the PIK3R1 mutant HS578T line was also determined to be sensitive to PP242. Approximately 70% of PIK3CA wild type lines were not sensitive to PP242. This suggests that mutations in the PI3K holoenzyme may be targetable by mTORC1/2 inhibition.	21358673	PubMed		Weigelt et al., 2011		2	accepted	1612	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1612	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/629	false

FBXW7 Loss-of-function	633	Cancer	162		Sirolimus		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	FBXW7 was shown to target mTOR for ubiquitination and degradation. A reciprocal relationship between FBXW7 or PTEN loss was identified in breast cancer tumors and cell lines (mutual exclusivity of these two events). In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.	18787170	PubMed		Mao et al., 2008		4	accepted	1632	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1632	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/633	false

Proliferation of three cell lines (KMS11, RPMI8226 and MM1S) but not U266 (only partial inhibition) was strongly inhibited by the BET inhibitors. Microarray analysis showed a downregulation of MYC-dependent genes after treatment. qRT-PCR showed that MYCL1 but not c-MYC and MYCN was expressed in U266 cells and I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1. In contrast, c-MYC but not MYCL was expressed in the other cell lines and I-BET151 induced downregulation of c-MYC.	27276402	PubMed		Suzuki et al., 2016		1	accepted	1706	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1706	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/666	false

SOX10 Loss	668	Melanoma	1909		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.	24670642	PubMed		Sun et al., 2014		4	accepted	1710	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1710	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/668	false

BRAF G596C	675	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Dabrafenib,Trametinib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Non-V600 BRAF mutations occur in about half of BRAF-mutated lung cancers, and their sensitivity to Dabrafenib and Trametinib is not well documented. In a cohort of 229 NSCLC patients that underwent molecular testing, one was found to have a BRAF G596C mutation. This mutation had low kinase activity and reduced MEK/ERK activation compared to wtBRAF in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Elevated MEK/ERK activation was seen when BRAF G596C was expressed in the presence of CRAF, and this activity was inhibited by both Dabrafenib and Trametinib. A lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) expressing BRAF G596C showed reduced ERK activation when treated with combination Dabrafenib and Trametinib. These results support the use of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in MAPK pathway inhibition in the context of kinase-impaired BRAF mutants such as G596C.	28947956	PubMed		Noeparast et al., 2017		2	accepted	1738	Somatic	2023-05-12 18:26:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1738	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/675	false

The meta-analysis investigated the association between CYP2D6 genotypes and response to tamoxifen treatment (loss/reduced function vs. unchanged/increased function). The authors examine a prevailing hypothesis that individuals carrying a reduced function CYP2D6 allele have poorer outcomes due to less metabolism of tamoxifen to active metabolites. The study concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support use of CYP2D6 genotyping as a guide for tamoxifen use in breast cancer.	24098545	PubMed		Lum et al., 2013		4	accepted	1784	Common Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1784	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/702	false

WWTR1::CAMTA1 Fusion	723	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	0080190				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2011 study, the authors investigated the genes involved in the t(1;3)(p36.3;q25) translocation associated with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) and its prevalence in a large spectrum of EHEs, including lesions from various anatomical locations and with differing malignant potential. The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.	21584898	PubMed		Errani et al., 2011		4	accepted	1805	Somatic	2024-05-02 11:30:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1805	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/723	false

Doxorubicin was part of the patient's treatment (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DOX, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) and was noted by authors as failing to control tumor growth.	27286459	PubMed		Murakami et al., 2016		2	accepted	1880	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1880	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/551	false
CDKN2A Loss	550	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	3507		Palbociclib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	An imatinib-resistant cell line, DFSP105, was established from a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans which had progressed to a high-grade fibrosarcomatous DFSP. The disease-associated COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was consistent with the most common form, a supernumerary ring chromosome. Genetic characterization of the cell line with a SNP array identified a homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion. Treatment of this cell line with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib led to growth inhibition and reduced RB1 phosphorylation in vitro and in-vivo.	25852058	PubMed		Eilers et al., 2015		2	accepted	1881	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1881	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/550	false

It was found to be upregulated in a set of TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer types. Depletion of AKT3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. It was found that depletion of Akt3 potentially inhibits the growth of TNBC cell lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, which imply that therapeutic targeting of AKT3 may provide a new treatment option for TNBCs.	24335962	PubMed		Chin et al., 2014		4	accepted	1923	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1923	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1275	false

PTEN R173C	812	Cancer	162				Predisposing	Supports	D	Uncertain Significance	"Han et al functionally tested the R173C mutation in PTEN using an expression vector construct, assessing phosphatase activity of the mutant construct with two phosphoinositide substrates (""with[ PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] or without[ Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] a diacylglycerol chain""). R173C resides in the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN. R173C was one of four mutations (out of 42 tested) that displayed no significant phosphatase activity against either substrate, indicating, by this assay, that the mutation negatively impacts the function of PTEN. However this mutation did not affect the ability of PTEN to bind lipid membranes in-vivo.

FGFR2 Amplification	625	Stomach Carcinoma	5517		Fexagratinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Nine patients with FGFR2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer were treated with AZD4547. Of these 9 patients, 3 showed confirmed responses to AZD4547. Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range=6.2-10.5). Two additional patients had a response in day 15 using FDG-PET but were not considered complete responders by RECIST criteria. High-level FGFR2-amplified (arbitrarily defined as FISH-ratio > 5) cancers had a higher likelihood of response and were associated with a substantially higher expression of both FGFR2 mRNA and FGFR2 protein (IHC). In vitro and in PDX models, FGFR2-amplified cell lines were sensitive to FGFR inhibition. Further preclinical analyses suggested, that FGFR2 amplification mainly signals via the PI3K pathway.	27179038	PubMed		Pearson et al., 2016		3	accepted	1990	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1990	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/625	false

ERBB2 Amplification	302	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	We identified 142 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors harbored both wild-type exons 2, 3, and 4 in KRAS and NRAS, and wild-type exon 15 in BRAF. All patients received cetuximab after oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine failure. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (HR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.18-6.31; P = 0.019). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between groups, although there was a tendency towards shorter OS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors (HR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.61-2.82; 10.1 vs. 13.5 months; P = 0.488).	28223103	PubMed		Jeong et al., 2017		3	accepted	1993	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1993	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

Univariate analysis identified gender, smoking history, histology and GNAS1 T393C polymorphism as predictive marker of PFS (P=0.04, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.005). Multivariate analysis of factors, including smoking history, performance status score, histology, GNAS1 T393C polymorphism demonstrated that GNAS1 T393C polymorphism was correlated independently with PFS (P=0.007).

The effect of panitumumab on PFS in the KRAS wt group was significantly greater than in the KRAS mutant group (HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59 vs HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36; P<0.0001). None of the 84 panitumumab-treated patients with KRAS mutant tumors responded to treatment (100% positive predictive value for nonresponse in mutant group). In the KRAS wt group treated with panitumumab (n=124), 21 patients had partial response (17%), 42 experienced stable disease (34%). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and BSC alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk).

MCF7-neo/HER2 cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K was associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations >0.01 ug/mL in both cell lines. Conversely, the cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K was resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on nude mice xenografted with PIK3CA E545K-harboring cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >3mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor suppression lasting >20 days after administration.	26920887	PubMed		Baselga et al., 2016		3	accepted	2036	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2036	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/104	false

EGFR Mutation	438	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Erlotinib,Gefitinib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In a retrospective study, 166 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that tended to have selected characteristics known to be predictive for TKI sensitivity (i.e. women, never smokers, and patients with ADC) were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. EGFR mutations (n=42) were associated with improved objective response to drug treatment (71.4% vs. 20.1%, p<0.0001), improved but not significant overall survival (36.9 vs. 24.8 months, p=0.09), and longer median time to progression (not reached vs. 3.7 months, p<0.0001) when compared to wild-type EGFR. Through multivariate analyses, it was shown that EGFR mutations are independent predictive favorable factors of response to drug treatment (p<0.0001) and are significant predictors of longer time to progression (HR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.14-0.52, p=0.0001)	21258250	PubMed		Ludovini et al., 2011		4	accepted	2053	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2053	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/438	false

PIK3CA E545K	104	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Pictilisib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study tested the efficacy on several breast cancer cell lines of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a selective inhibitor of all four isoforms of class I PI3-kinases at a range of IC50 values. Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted. Authors concluded that pictilisib had a modest effect on cell cycle progression and encouraged apoptosis in this cell line, and that this cell line is sensitive to pictilisib. Authors further noted that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like breast cancer cell lines (p=0.002).	20453058	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010		4	accepted	2062	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2062	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/104	false

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02).	20453058	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010		2	accepted	2074	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2074	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. Three cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R. T-47D is a luminal type breast cancer cell line, and it had an IC50 of 0.22uM. Treatment with GDC-0941 resulted in a substantial reduction of phosphorylated AKT. BT-20 is a basal breast cancer cell line which had an ICD50 of 0.62uM. MFM-223 is basal cell line that had an ICD50 of 2.10uM, and experienced some reduction in pAKT. Authors note that luminal-like cell lines were generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal-like (p=0.02).	20453058	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010		2	accepted	2102	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2102	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/107	false
PIK3CA H1047R	107	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Trastuzumab Emtansine		Predictive	Does Not Support	D	Resistance	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was compared to that of trastuzumab against various HER2 positive cell lines. HCC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in all three cell lines. Conversely, the cell lines harboring PIK3CA H1047R were resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with KPL-4 (PIK3CA H1047R cells) resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.	26920887	PubMed		Baselga et al., 2016		3	accepted	2103	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2103	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/107	false

PIK3CA E545K	104	Rectum Cancer	1993				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study examined outcomes of 240 rectum cancer patients treated with total mesorectal excision therapy. Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA exon 10 and 21 mutations (listed as exon 9 and 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). Of the 19 patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA mutations, nine harbored PIK3CA E545K. PIK3CA E545K was associated with poor outcome compared to other PIK3CA mutations for local and distant recurrences (HR: 11.6, P < 0.001; HR 3.7, P = 0.006).

Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with gefitinib and achieved a partial response, but subsequently tumor progression occurred; however, osimertinib treatment resulted a favorable tumor response with the extinguishment of the EGFR T790M mutation. In a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring an EGFR L858R mutation and an acquired EGFR T790M co-mutation, EGFR T790M was associated with sensitivity to osimertinib monotherapy. Prior to the development of the EGFR T790M mutation, the patient was treated with erlotinib, followed by gefitinib for 12 months and achieved stable disease, but subsequently metastasis occurred; the EGFR T790M was then identified and subsequent 10 month treatment with osimertinib monotherapy resulted in a 45% disease regression.	26269204	PubMed		Planchard et al., 2015		2	accepted	2157	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2157	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/34	false

Patients harboring BRAF mutations (total n=24, V600E n=23, D594G n=1) had a lower response rate than did patients with wildtype BRAF (n=326; 2/24 [4.3%] vs 124/326 [38%], OR: 0.15, p=0.0012). BRAF mutant patients also experienced significantly lower disease control rate, PFS, and OS (median 26 vs 54 weeks, HR: 3.03 p<0.0001) in response to cetuximab treatment. In multivariate analysis, the significant associations between BRAF mutations and poor outcome were confirmed. The authors noted that two responders had the following genotypes: V600E mutation in low copy number, and BRAF D594G, and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		3	accepted	2187	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2187	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/395	false

NRAS Mutation	208	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Chemotherapy,Cetuximab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 605 patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab + chemotherapy. Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment. Authors suggest screening for mutations in the following gene order: KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA exon 21 (listed as PIK3CA exon 20 in the source).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		2	accepted	2210	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2210	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/208	false

Cells were treated with doxorubicin to induce double-strand (DSB) and p21 induction was monitored by qPCR. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. A patient sample had the T2666A variant of ATM, confirmed by sanger sequencing, in trans with a loss of function 11q deletion found in 91% of cells by FISH. Western blot showed null ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was much lower than the median expression level of treated controls which was 815% that of untreated controls, supporting resistance.	23585524	PubMed		Navrkalova et al., 2013		3	accepted	2221	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2221	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/875	false
ATM Mutation	178	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	1040		Doxorubicin		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were treated with doxorubicin to induce double-strand (DSB). In this setting, cells harboring rare ATM variants (n=8) had significantly higher viability, measured by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, compared to wildtype cells (n=8, p < 0.001) suggesting resistance. A qPCR functional assay showed that samples with rare ATM variants (n= 20) had significantly less p21 expression after treatment with doxorubicin compared to treated wildtype controls (n=31, p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was significantly decreased expression of BBC3, BAX, and GADD45 genes which are downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response.

In a patient sample with the R3008C variant of ATM in trans with a wild-type allele, confirmed by sanger sequencing, western blot showed stable ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was much lower than the median expression level of treated controls which was 815% that of untreated controls, supporting resistance. The authors propose that this variant has a dominant-negative effect.	23585524	PubMed		Navrkalova et al., 2013		3	accepted	2223	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2223	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/877	false

This patient did not respond to irinotecan and cetuximab combination therapy and experienced progression free survival (PFS) lasting less than 10 months and overall survival (OS) lasting less than 30 months. Median PFS for patients with BRAF, KRAS G12/G13 wildtype tumors harboring mutations in either KRAS codon 146 (n=1) or KRAS codon 61 (n=7) was lower than patients whose tumors were additionally wildtype for KRAS A146 and Q61 (PFS: 3.8 vs 5.3mo, p= 0.023), though there wasn't a significant difference in overall survival (OS: 9.7 vs 14.8 mo, p=0.320).	19603018	PubMed		Loupakis et al., 2009		3	accepted	2225	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2225	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/879	false

EFM-192A cell line expressing PIK3CA C420R was associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; substantially reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in both cell lines. Conversely, when treated with trastuzumab, the cell line harboring PIK3CA C420R experienced a smaller reduction in cell viability.	26920887	PubMed		Baselga et al., 2016		3	accepted	2346	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:40 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2346	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/905	false
PIK3CA Mutation	307	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Erlotinib,Gefitinib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	In a retrospective study, 166 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that tended to have selected characteristics known to be predictive for TKI sensitivity (i.e. women, never smokers, and patients with ADC) were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. PIK3CA mutations (n=6) were associated with no difference in objective response to drug treatment (16.6% vs. 35.2%, p=0.61), shorter overall survival (9.9 vs. 30.2 months, p<0.001), and shorter median time to progression (2.3 vs. 6.0 months, p=0.01) when compared to wild-type PIK3CA. Through multivariate analyses, it was shown that PIK3CA mutations are significant predictors of worse overall survival (HR: 5.81, 95% CI: 2.43-13.91, p=0.0001) and shorter time to progression (HR: 2.71 95% CI: 1.23-4.79, p=0.03).	21258250	PubMed		Ludovini et al., 2011		3	accepted	2355	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2355	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false

Of patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutated GISTs, 11 (47.8%) had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 2 were nonassessable. Patients with KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with WT KIT (P = .013), though significantly less likely than those with KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs (P = .0006). Patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 200 days) than those with WT KIT GISTs (82 days). Furthermore, there was a signficant difference in overall survival between patients with KIT exon 9 mutant and double WT kinase GISTs (P = .0067).

PDGFRA Mutation	3143	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective study of 127 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs.	14645423	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2003		3	accepted	2487	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2487	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3143	false

ABCB1 Overexpression	2784	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	8552		Bafetinib,Dasatinib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	The BCR-ABL1 expressing imatinib-resistant cell line K562/D1-9 overexpresses P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a known drug membrane transporter. Bafetinib (INNO-406) and dasatinib showed drastically higher IC50 values (970.3 nM and 91nM) in K562/D1-9 than the non-resistant K562 cell line (24.7 nM and 1.5nM), suggesting resistance in the presence of ABCB1 overexpression.

ATM C2488Y	1146	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	1040		Doxorubicin		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, some of whom had prior therapy. The effect of the C2488Y variant on ATM expression was tested by western blot, and the effect on ATM function was tested by treating with doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and monitoring p21 induction. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. A patient sample had the C2488Y variant of ATM, confirmed by sanger sequencing, in trans with a loss of function 11q deletion found in 90% of cells by FISH. Western blot showed stable ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was much lower than the median expression level of treated controls which was 815% that of untreated controls, supporting resistance.	23585524	PubMed		Navrkalova et al., 2013		3	accepted	2849	Rare Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2849	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1146	false

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 5 had somatic BRCA2 mutation, 4 of which were homozygous mutations and one had unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 80% (4/5) of the somatic BRCA2 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594	PubMed		Swisher et al., 2017	NCT01891344	2	accepted	2868	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2868	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/186	false

GNAS c.393T>C	851	Melanoma	1909				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study showed that GNAS1 T393C SNP represents a genetic host factor for predicting tumor progression in patients with malignant melanoma. Carriers of the C-allele showed a significantly more severe tumor progression as estimated from the time period to develop metastasis (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, p = 0.017). Proportions of 5-year metastasis-free intervals were 87.1% for TT genotypes and 66.0% for C-allele carriers.

MGMT Underexpression	1229	Glioblastoma	3068		Temozolomide		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.	17442989	PubMed		Chinot et al., 2007		3	accepted	2899	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2899	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1229	false

Because of this mutation's rarity and the variability of responses of treated cases, its exact prognostic and predictive role is not fully understood. In our experience, S768I mutations in isolation do not necessarily confer sensitivity to erlotinib, but in conjunction with sensitizing EGFR mutations, S768I mutations do not restrict efficacy.	27211795	PubMed		Leventakos et al., 2016		2	accepted	2906	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2906	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/558	false

RET C609Y	1234	Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma	3973				Predisposing	Supports	B	Predisposition	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically. 22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically. The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3', 'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	PubMed		Calva et al., 2009		4	accepted	2913	Rare Germline	2023-01-12 06:23:20 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2913	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1234	false

Over half of melanoma cell lines overexpressed MERTK compared with normal human melanocytes; however, overexpression did not correlate with mutations in BRAF or RAS. MERTK inhibition via shRNA reduced MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, reduced colony formation by up to 59%, and diminished tumor volume by 60% in a human melanoma murine xenograft model. Treatment of melanoma cells with UNC1062, a novel MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced activation of MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, induced apoptosis in culture, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells.	23585477	PubMed		Schlegel et al., 2013		3	accepted	2991	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2991	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1273	false

CTNNB1 S45P	1261	Desmoid Tumor	0080366				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare, nonmetastatic neoplasm marked by local invasiveness and relentless recurrence. Beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids. CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: T41A (59%), S45F (33%), and S45P (8%). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in S45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either T41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%). Because of their low frequency, patients with S45P mutations were excluded from these analyses but showed a recurrence course similar to T41A or wild type patients.	18832571	PubMed		Lazar et al., 2008		1	accepted	3043	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3043	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1261	false

BRAF Non-V600	2281	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	This study of 9,643 patients characterized clinical implications of non-V600 BRAF mutations in metastatic CRC. Of the patients with metastatic CRC that underwent NGS testing, 208 patients had non-V600 BRAF mutations (22% of BRAF mutations identified and 2.2% of total patients tested ). When compared to V600 BRAF mutations, tumors without V600 BRAF mutations were more prevalent in younger patients (58 v 68 years, respectively) and male patients (65% vs 46%, respectively). Additionally, non-V600 BRAF mutations were less prevalent in high-grade tumors (13% v 64%, respectively) and right-sided primary tumors (36% v 81%, respectively). Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients with non-V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC compared with those with both V600E BRAF-mutant and wild-type BRAF metastatic CRC (60.7 v 11.4 v 43.0 months).	28486044	PubMed		Jones et al., 2017		5	accepted	3046	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3046	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2281	false

Patients with KRAS mutant tumors (total [n = 253], codon 12 [n=183], 13 [n=47], 59 [n=1], 61 [n=13], 146 [n=9]) had a significantly lower response rate (17/253; 6.7%) compared to patients with KRAS wt tumors (126/352; 35.8%; OR: .13; P < .0001). Patients with KRAS mutant tumors also experienced significant lower disease control rate, shorter median progression free survival and overall survival. Association between KRAS mutation status and outcome was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Authors note that these patients were treated with cetuximab prior to widespread adoption of regular KRAS mutational status screening.

M229 cells virally transduced with PIK3CA E545K were significantly more resistant to vemurafenib-mediated growth suppression than cells transduced with empty vectors (50% vs 20% survival at the highest concentration, p <.0001). Furthermore, E545K appears to confer more resistance to vemurafenib than PIK3CA D350G and similar levels of resistance as E545G. Resistance was determined by assessing cell survival.	24265155	PubMed		Shi et al., 2014		2	accepted	3722	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3722	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/104	false

PIK3CA Exon 21 Mutation	105	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutations, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21 (listed as exon 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 21 mutation was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.11 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012		2	accepted	3729	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3729	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/105	false

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks). Authors suggest that PIK3CA exon 21 mutations are more relevant to cetuximab response than PIK3CA mutations as a whole, as PIK3CA exon 10 mutations do not appear to effect cetuximab response (exons are listed as exon 20 and exon 9 in the source).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		2	accepted	3732	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3732	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false

In the KRAS wildtype group, erlotinib showed a significant benefit for progression free survival (PFS) over placebo (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.87, P<0.001). No statistically significant improvement in PFS was seen with erlotinib in the KRAS mutant group over placebo. Significant difference in PFS between erlotinib treated KRAS WT and MUT patients was not seen. Overall, in the intent to treat population erlotinib significantly improved PFS over placebo (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82; P<0.001).	21969500	PubMed		Brugger et al., 2011		3	accepted	3895	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3895	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false
KRAS Q61	203	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab,Chemotherapy	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 605 patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab + chemotherapy. Patients harboring KRAS codon 61 mutations (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with KRAS wildtype tumors (0/13 vs 123/345; p= .0055). Authors consider KRAS codon 61 mutations as supporting resistance to cetuximab and suggest that it should be included in KRAS mutation screening.

KRAS G12C	78	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab,Chemotherapy	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. Of those, 16 patients harbored KRAS G12C, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 9 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=15) and cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1). Median PFS was 11 weeks (6-65 weeks), median OS was 24 weeks (14-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 62 years old (46-73), and there were 8 males and 8 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		3	accepted	3967	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3967	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/78	false

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, KRAS G12C expressing SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth. Mice injected with KRAS wt cells did not significantly respond to regorafenib, although a trend was seen toward better response. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed no significant change in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS G12C expressing mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS wt expressing mice whose tumors displayed more pronounced changes. Authors concluded that G12C was more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt and other common KRAS G12/G13 mutants.	26161928	PubMed		Camaj et al., 2015		2	accepted	3973	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3973	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/78	false

EGFR L858R	33	Cancer	162		Erlotinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib. These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.	17877814	PubMed		de Gunst et al., 2007		3	accepted	4265	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4265	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/33	false

PIK3CA E542K	103	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab		Predictive	Does Not Support	C	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 7 patients harbored PIK3CA E542K (exon 10), were wt for BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA, and had individual response data. Two patients had partial response, three had stable disease, and two progressed, resulting in a response rate of 2/7 and a clinical benefit rate of 5/7 according to author criteria. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1), and cetuximab monotherapy (n=1). Median PFS was 34 weeks (17-48 weeks), median OS was 46 weeks (27-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 59 years old (53-74), and there were 6 females and one male. Using these and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that PIK3CA exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in source) mutations are associated with weak or no resistance to cetuximab.	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010		3	accepted	4424	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4424	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/103	false

KIT T670I	1241	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Regorafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	A preclinical study tested the effects of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on Ba/F3 cell lines with representative primary regorafenib-sensitizing mutation del 557-558, which induced IL-3 independent growth, and secondary mutation T670I. The cells were tested for Regorafenib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/T670I mutations (IC50 = 132 +- 25 nM) did show resistance towards Regorafenib compared to Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 alone (IC50 = 30 +- 14 nM). In addition, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Regorafenib. In Regorafenib incubated cells, T670I mutations were seen in approximately 10% of the resistant cell populations. The results suggest that T670I does induce regorafenib resistance in del 557-558/T670I cells.	25239608	PubMed		Garner et al., 2014		4	accepted	4510	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4510	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1241	false

The cells were tested for Imatinib and Sunitinib resistances. GIST-T1/816 cells with 560-578 deletion and D816E mutations were resistant towards Imatinib and Sunitinib (Imatinib IC50: 604 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 3111 nM) compared to GIST-T1 cells with the 560-578 deletion mutation alone (Imatinib IC50: 30 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 15 nM). Imatinib inhibited phosphorylation in KIT and ERK at high concentrations. Sunitinib did not inhibit phosphorylation in KIT, ERK, or AKT at all. Additionally, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Sunitinib and Imatinib separately.

Confirmed partial response (PR) was observed in 21% (10/47) patients receiving trametinib/docetaxel. The ORR was 18% (4 PR in 22 patients) in KRAS wild-type versus 24% (six PR in 25 patients) in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Of the 42 patients treated with trametinib/pemetrexed, 14% (6/42) had a PR; the ORR was 17% (4/23) in KRAS-mutated NSCLC versus 11% (2/19) in KRAS wild-type NSCLC.	27876675	PubMed		Gandara et al., 2017	NCT01192165	3	accepted	4862	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4862	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false
KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Atezolizumab,Nivolumab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	A meta-analysis of randomized trials to investigate if KRAS mutation status affects survival benefits of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in patients with advanced NSCLC. Of 3 eligible studies using either nivolumab or atezolizumab, 138 patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC and 371 with KRAS wild-type were included. ICI improved overall survival over that with docetaxel in KRAS mutant, previously-treated advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio=0.64 [95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.96], P = 0.03) but not in those with KRAS wild-type tumor (HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68-1.13], P = 0.30). These results suggest that KRAS mutation status may be a potential biomarker for survival benefits to ICIs.	28525386	PubMed		Kim et al., 2017		3	accepted	4863	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4863	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false
KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor		Predictive	Supports	E	Sensitivity/Response	This meta-analysis of 5 studies with 752 non-small cell lung cancer patients examined the association between PD-L1 expression and KRAS mutation status. KRAS-mutant tumors were marginally more likely to be PD-L1 positive than KRAS-wild type tumors (51% vs 36%; odds ratio: 1.69; 95% CI 1.01-2.84; p = 0.045). Authors concluded that this result contributes to a theoretical basis for including PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other molecularly targeted drugs in the treatment of patients with KRAS mutations.	28259530	PubMed		Li et al., 2017		2	accepted	4864	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4864	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false

KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Trametinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase II trial, trametinib or docetaxel was given to patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (HR 1.14; p = 0.5197). Median OS, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; P = 0.934). There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000). These data suggest that trametinib is associated with similar PFS and response rates as docetaxel.	25722381	PubMed		Blumenschein et al., 2015	NCT01362296	4	accepted	4867	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4867	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false
KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Selumetinib,Erlotinib	Combination	Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	38 KRAS wild-type patients were randomized to erlotinib or combination of selumetinib with erlotinib. 41 KRAS mutant patients were randomized to selumetinib or the combination. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) for the KRAS wild-type cohort and objective response rate (ORR) for the KRAS mutant cohort. Median PFS in the KRAS wild-type arm was 2.4 months for erlotinib alone and 2.1 months for the combination. The ORR in the KRAS mutant group was 0% for selumetinib alone and 10% for the combination. These data suggest no difference in ORR or PFS with combination therapy of over monotherapy in KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type advanced NSCLC.	26802155	PubMed		Carter et al., 2016	NCT01229150	4	accepted	4868	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4868	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false

In four families, three different coding sequence substitutions causing a 15 amino-acid extension from the original stop codon of the VHL gene were described. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard procedures. Sequence analysis consisted of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and automated fluorescence sequencing of all three VHL exons. Patient 1 (family 1), female, presented with a pheochromocytoma at age 11, a pheochromocytoma at age 20, bilateral retinal hemangioblastoma at age 20, and a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at age 20. She had a family history of early onset pheochromocytoma. She was found to have a substitution mutation in the VHL gene causing a loss of the stop codon, and an extension of 14 amino acids on the C-terminal end of the protein (c.641G>T (p.*241Lext*14). This mutation is noted as p.*241Lext*15 in the paper due to a difference in nomenclature.) Her mother was found to have the same mutation. Her mother had two pheochromocytomas at age 12, and was found to have bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas at age 40. Her brother was found to have a pheochromocytoma at age 13, but was not sequenced.

PIK3CA Exon 21 Mutation AND PIK3CA Exon 10 Mutation	5317	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This was a prospective study involving 1,170 colorectal cancer patients confirmed by histology. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012		2	accepted	5350	Somatic	2024-12-05 21:39:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5350	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5317	false

RRM1 Underexpression	1231	Pancreatic Cancer	1793		Gemcitabine		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MiaPaCa2, which is a gemcitabine-sensitive cell line, was used for the establishment of chemoresistant cells MiaPaCa2-RG. Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speciﬁc RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive. Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).	17131328	PubMed		Nakahira et al., 2007		3	accepted	5508	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5508	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1231	false

In 43 of those pairs, the expression level of ARID1A was significantly lower in the cancerous tissue than in the normal tissue (P=0.0029). This was then again tested using Western Blotting. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, there was a lower expression of ARID1A in 13 of the tumor tissue samples compared to the normal tissue samples (P=0.0015). In an immunohistochemical analysis of 224 tissue blocks, 115 of those had a decreased ARID1A expression. The data conveyed that lower ARID1A expression was correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (P=0.001). Lastly, cell proliferation in regards to ARID1A expression was tested in cell lines.

Of these 60 patients, 9 (15%) patients had a loss of ARID1A expression. Results showed that a low ARID1A expression was significantly related to advanced FIGO stages (P=0.02) and high CA125 levels (P=0.01). Patients with low expression experienced shorter progression free survival than those with no loss of expression (P<0.01). In a multivariate analysis it was found that a loss of ARID1A expression was significant for shorter disease free survival (P=0.03) and shorter overall survival for patients whose ovarian clear cell carcinoma was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.015).

VHL L184P (c.551T>C)	1652	Renal Cell Carcinoma	4450	Sporadic,Renal cell carcinoma			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In a study of 31 kidney tumors from France, 14 somatic VHL mutations were found. Most tumors were found to have heterozygous pattern of mutation likely due to contamination of renal cancer tissues with non-tumor cells. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumors, lymphocytes and cell lines using standard phenol/chloroform extraction or salt extraction protocols. Three sets of primers were designed to amplify the entire exons 2 and 3 and the last one third 3'-region of exon 1, the genotyping method used was PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism). A metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma sample (sample 3087) was obtained from a 68 year old male who was known to smoke one pack of cigarettes per day and had intense alcohol drinking habits. In this patient's tumor (sample 3087), a c.551T>C variant (noted in the paper as nucleotide 764) was identified as a somatic mutation, found only in the tumor. The second mutation, a C>G transversion, c.183C>G (p.P61=) (noted in the paper at nucleotide 396) was present in the non-tumor DNA, a germline synonymous mutation. The patient had no metastasis after nephrectomy and patients survival was >4 months.

Osimertinib failed to induce substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2 in NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I or ERBB2 wt. AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation to a greater extent in the mutant and wildtype cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 wt, ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed did not show substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK or S6. AZ5104 induced greater reductions. Authors note that AZ5104 is not being developed independently of osimertinib and only 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans.

Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively.

PIK3CA Exon 21 Mutation	105	Breast Cancer	1612				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	An Italian study of 163 malignant breast tumors assessed the association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical outcome. Of the 163 tumors sequenced, 118 had wild-type (wt) PIK3CA, 24 had exon 9 (helical domain) missense mutations, and 21 had exon 20 (kinase domain) missense mutations. The study found that patients with exon 20 mutations showed significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS) compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (P=.011 and P = .01, respectively). Furthermore, patients with exon 20 mut showed especially better OS and DFS than patients with exon 9 mutations (P=.0018 and P=.0017, respectively). The 21 cases with exon 20 mutations had excellent prognosis with no recurrences or deaths, whereas there were 10 recurrences and 9 deaths among the 24 cases of exon 9 mutations, in observed period.

However, the authors identify Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V variants as resistant as they had an IC50 of >150nM. In patients with F359C and/or F359V mutations prior to nilotinib treatment, complete hematological responses were achieved in 3 of 10 patients, a major cytogenetic response in 1 of 11 patients, a complete cytogenetic response in 0 of 11 patients, and major molecular response in 0 of 10 patients. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, 9 of 11 patients with this mutation progressed or died. The F359C mutation was present in 1 patient at baseline and newly emerged in 1 patient at progression. The F359V mutation was present in 4 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 1 patient at progression.	19652056	PubMed		Hughes et al., 2009		3	accepted	6233	Somatic	2023-12-20 21:26:52 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6233	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4680	false

This patient was a 38 year old female with stage IV M1a melanoma who took dabrafenib (35 mg twice daily to 100 mg three times a day). The best overall response was a 100% reduction in the sum of target lesions, and progression free survival lasted 119 days. Prior to dabrafenib monotherapy, this patient's baseline tumor harbored BRAF V600K—no other somatic alterations were noted. Following relapse, the patient gained AKT1 Q79K in one of two disease progressive tumors. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger re-sequencing were used for all tumors. The authors hypothesized that disruptions in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway represent a core mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy.	24265155	PubMed		Shi et al., 2014		4	accepted	6260	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6260	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/169	false

This patient was an 83 year old male with stage IV M1c melanoma who took vemurafenib (960mg twice daily). The best overall response was a 5% increase in sum of target lesions, and progression free survival lasted 132 days. Prior to vemurafenib monotherapy, this patient harbored BRAF V600K and no other somatic genetic alterations noted in the baseline tumor. Following relapse, the patient gained PREX2 R172I in one of two disease progressive tumors. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger re-sequencing were used for all tumors. The authors indicated that the biology behind this potential resistance mutation was unknown.	24265155	PubMed		Shi et al., 2014		4	accepted	6268	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6268	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2237	false

The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I.	21865346	PubMed		Cortes et al., 2011	NCT00261846	3	accepted	6337	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6337	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2249	false
BRCA1 Mutation	185	Ovarian Cancer	2394		Rucaparib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	A phase 2 trial on patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part1, NCT01891344) was held to assess PARP inhibitor rucaparib on 3 genetically defined subsets of patients. Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 14 had germline BRCA1 mutation, 13 of which were homozygous mutation and one with unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 86% (12/14) of the germline BRCA1 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594	PubMed		Swisher et al., 2017	NCT01891344	3	accepted	6341	Rare Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6341	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/185	false
ABL1 TKD Mutation	2244	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	8552		Nilotinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Resistance	In this open-label, phase II registration trial, patients that were imatinib resistant (n = 192) or intolerant (n = 89) underwent nilotinib monotherapy. Prior to nilotinib treatment, 105 and 9 patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations were imatinib resistant and intolerant, respectively. Within 12 months of therapy, among patients with baseline mutations, complete hematologic response was achieved in 57 (71%) of 80 [vs. 35 (80%) of 80 Abl1 wildtype patients, P = .393], major cytogenetic response in 49 of 100 [vs. 52 (60%) of 87, P = .145], complete cytogenetic response in 32 of 100 [vs. 35 (40%) of 87, P = .285], and major molecular response in 19 (22%) of 87 [vs. 22 (29%) of 76, P = .366]. These data shows no significant difference in nilotinib efficacy between patients with baseline mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without. The authors observe clinical efficacy of nilotinib for many of the 29 variants found and identify only Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V as resistance conferring variants with IC50 greater than 150 nM. Individuals with T315I variants (3% of total population) were excluded.	19652056	PubMed		Hughes et al., 2009		3	accepted	6342	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6342	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2244	false

PIK3CA Mutation	307	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Panitumumab,Cetuximab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	Mutational analysis of 110 metastatic colorectal cancer patients was used to examine objective tumor response, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) following treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). In univariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations (H1047R or E545K) were significantly associated with lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab (objective response rate: 0/15 vs 22/95 for patients harboring PIK3CA mutated or wildtype tumors, respectively; P = 0.038). Multivariate logistic regression of KRAS mutations, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN protein expression also confirmed an independent effect of PIK3CA mutation on objective response (P = 0.0337; OR = 0.1153; CI for OR: 0.000–0.865). Patients with tumors harboring either PIK3CA H1047R or E545K mutations (15/109) had decreased PFS, compared to those with wild-type tumors (P = 0.0035), though they had a nonsignificant difference in OS. Authors note a trend in decreasing OS in patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors.	19223544	PubMed		Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2009		3	accepted	6362	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6362	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false

PIK3CA Mutation	307	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Aspirin		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803) and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012		3	accepted	6375	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6375	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false
ABL1 R351W	1564	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In this in vitro study, the H1915 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (homozygous for a R351W mutation) was shown to be susceptible to imatinib. This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680	PubMed		Testoni et al., 2016		5	accepted	6376	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:47 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1564	false

Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations. 15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2).	27371698	PubMed		Ben-Ami et al., 2016	NCT01068769	3	accepted	6377	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6377	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/66	false

Of 751 melanomas analyzed by next-generation sequencing, 4 metastatic melanomas were identified with NTRK fusions, 3 involving NTRK1 (TRIM63, DDR2, and GON4L), 1 involving NTRK2 (TRAF2). All tumors were cytologically characterized by the presence of large epithelioid melanocytes and were immunoreactive with anti-Trk antibody. The NTRK1-TRIM63 fusion occurred in a 63 yo man with a nodular melanoma with the primary tumor on the shin and skin and lymph node metastases. No known melanoma drivers were identified as co-occurring in this patient.

The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	29848605	PubMed		Pal et al., 2018		3	accepted	6409	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6409	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/808	false

The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO‐101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions.	27093299	PubMed		Nagasubramanian et al., 2016		2	accepted	6473	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6473	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

The authors compare NTRK3-ETV6 (and include 2 other NTRK fusion samples) to PTCs with BRAF(V) (600E) and find they are associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); The authors conclude that NTRK fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population.	26784937	PubMed		Prasad et al., 2016		3	accepted	6474	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6474	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	29623306	PubMed		Shukla et al., 2017		3	accepted	6475	Somatic	2024-02-08 20:11:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6475	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

ETV6::NTRK3 Fusion	779	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Early young adult onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.	29880614	PubMed		Roberts et al., 2018		4	accepted	6930	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

The patient had a complex karyotype and microarray revealed a 9p duplication involving JAK2 and deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A. RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry.

EGFR V441F	2486	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Panitumumab,Cetuximab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	E	Resistance	Next-generation sequencing data of cfDNA from 1,397 patients with colorectal cancer identified a novel cluster of extracellular domain (ECD). EGFR V441G/D/F mutations were found in 19% (n=8) of patients with EGFR ECD domain III (location of cetuximab and panitumumab binding epitope) mutations. V441D and V441G were more common than V441F. Resistance of V441G to cetuximab was modeled in silico, and authors predicted that it destroys a critical hydrophobic node. In vitro, V441G/D transduced NIH3T3 cells had significantly reduced binding to panitumumab and cetuximab compared to EGFR wt NH3T3 cells (p<0.01 for all comparisons to wt). Authors inferred that EGFR domain III (ECD) mutations, including V441F, may be responsible for secondary resistance to EGFR blockade.	29196463	PubMed		Strickler et al., 2018		2	accepted	7096	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7096	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2486	false

A 2cm x 1.8cm x 1.5cm lesion close to costovertebral angle of third right thoracic vertebra was found via PET scan were histological findings found this to be consistent with paraganglioma. Blood samples for genomic DNA analysis were taken and screening for mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, NF1, FH, MDH2, and EPAS1 genes was negative but she was positive for a heterozygous mutation in the VHL gene, c.311G > T (p.Gly104Val). This same variant was found in her 17 year-old sister and her mother but not in her father. Her mother refused a complete staging. The probands sister presented with a small retinal hemangioblastoma at this time. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM2' since this variant is absent from controls (gnomAD), 'PP1' since there is cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members, 'PP2' since we have a missense variant in a gene where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.	29789510	PubMed		Bahougne et al., 2018		3	accepted	7134	Rare Germline	2023-09-01 15:51:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7134	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2301	false

When comparing patients with wildtype KRAS (n=625), BRAF V600E tumors had worse outcomes relative to BRAF wildtype. For patients with BRAF V600E tumors (n=566), median overall survival (OS) was 25.1 months with cetuximab and 21.6 months without cetuximab. For patients with wildtype BRAF (n=59), median OS was 14.1 months with cetuximab and 10.3 months without cetuximab.	21502544	PubMed		Van Cutsem et al., 2011		4	accepted	7157	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7157	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false
BRAF Mutation	395	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In the Medical Research Council (MRC) COIN trial, ISRCTN27286448, patients who presented with advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to chemotherapy (oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine; arm A), or chemotherapy plus cetuximab (arm B). Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients. BRAF mutations were found in 102/1291 samples (7.90%), and of these, 12 were D594G and 90 V600E.	21641636	PubMed		Maughan et al., 2011		4	accepted	7158	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7158	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/395	false
BRAF Mutation	395	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	A meta analysis was performed using data from 21 published studies (n = 9885 patients) to assess prognostic value of BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer. When evaluating 14 studies (n = 7778 patients), the odds ratio (OR) of a proximal lesion, which is associated with greater mortality in colon cancer, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 5.222, 95% CI 3.801–7.174, P < 0.001). When evaluating 4 studies (n = 1526 patients), the odds ratio of T4 tumors, which indicates tumor growth past bowel lining, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 1.761, 95% CI 1.164–2.663, P = 0.007). When evaluating 8 studies (n = 2786 patients), the odds ratio of poor tumor differentiation was increased in patients with BRAF mutations (OR 3.816, 95% CI 2.714–5.365, P < 0.001). These results support that BRAF mutations indicate poor prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.	24112392	PubMed		Clancy et al., 2013		4	accepted	7159	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7159	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/395	false

TERT Promoter Mutation	220	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830	Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Prognostic	Supports	C	Poor Outcome	The aim of this Chinese study was to identify prognostic biomarkers for pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGG). Approximately 300 patients were included. Using Sanger sequencing, mutations at TERT promoter (TERTp) regions were identified (C228T: 3/278; C250T: 4/278). The median age of patients with TERTp mutations was 15 years. There were 5 males and 2 females. Six patients had diffuse astrocytoma and one had pilocytic astrocytoma. Tumors were found in the midline of four patients, the hemisphere of two, and the cerebellum of one. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that TERTp mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival [mt (n=6) vs wt (n=205); p<0.0001 for both OS and PFS]. However, the association of TERTp mutations with OS and PFS was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, grade, histology, tumor location, and extent of resection in multivariate analysis.	29948154	PubMed		Yang et al., 2018		4	accepted	7188	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7188	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/220	false

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that H3F3A mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [15 cases with H3F3A mutation (n=15) vs wt (n=197); p<0.0001 for both OS and PFS]. A further multivariate analysis indicated H3F3A mutation as an independent, unfavorable prognosis marker for both PFS [HR 2.76 (95% CI 1.10–6.94); p = 0.031] and OS [HR 3.96 (95% CI 1.36–11.53); p = 0.012].	29948154	PubMed		Yang et al., 2018		4	accepted	7189	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7189	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2521	false
ATRX Underexpression	644	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830	Pediatric onset,Early young adult onset			Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Loss of ATRX was identified in 12 of 247 patients with PLGGs using immunohistochemistry.

An association between this alteration and BRAFV600E was detected (p=0.0001). Hemispheric tumors with CDKN2A deletion were associated with shorter progression-free survival (p=0.0073) but did not affect overall survival (p=0.5) [mt (n=10) vs wt (n=59)]. CDKN2A deletion remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis for PFS [HR 4.38 (95% CI 1.05–18.23); p = 0.043].

KIAA1549::BRAF Fusion	614	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830		Everolimus,Trametinib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study proposed to use a combination therapy of an MEK inhibitor (e.g. trametinib) and an mTOR inhibitor (e.g. everolimus) for the treatment of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) with BRAF fusions to evade acquired resistance to MEK targeted therapy. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was identified as a resistance mechanism to MEKi treatment based on RNASeq and GSEA analysis. Using flank xenograft model, mice were injected with NIH3T3 cells expressing KIAA1549-BRAF fusions and treated daily with trametinib, everolimus either alone or combined with each other (n=~10 for each treatment arm). Combination therapy (Trametinib 1mg/kg+ Everolimus 10mg/kg) resulted in better suppression in tumor growth than single-agent treatment. Similarly, combination treatment strongly reduced colony formation as well as pERK and pS6 levels, showing on target effects.	29156677	PubMed		Jain et al., 2017		2	accepted	7199	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7199	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/614	false
KIAA1549::BRAF Fusion	614	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	Hawkins et al. (2011) retrospectively studied 70 consecutive patient with incompletely resected pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGA). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified in 60% of cases in this cohort. Multi-variant analysis suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was the most significant favorable prognosis factor in incompletely resected PLGA and was independent of location, pathology, and age. Five-year PFS of fusion positive and fusion negative patients were 61% +/- 8% and 18% +/- 8% (P=0.0004), respectively. These results suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion confers a less aggressive clinical phenotype on PLGA and may explain their tendency to growth arrest.	21610142	PubMed		Hawkins et al., 2011		4	accepted	7200	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7200	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/614	false
FGFR1 Internal Duplication	2528	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830	Pediatric onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This GWAS study identified a structural variant of FGFR1. Duplication of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FGFR1 was found in 11 of 149 patients (13/151 tumor samples, including 2 recurrent tumors) with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) and related low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). This alteration resulted in autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and subsequent activation of downstream PI3K and MAPK/ERK pathways. Also, transfection of Tp53-null astrocytes with TDK duplicated FGFR1 and implantation into the brains of nude mice results in high-grade astrocytic tumours with short latency and complete penetrance. Of note, this variant was present in 24% (8 of 34) of grade II diffuse cerebral gliomas.	23583981	PubMed		Zhang et al., 2013		4	accepted	7203	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7203	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2528	false

The patient received a successful bone marrow transplant and at day 100 showed a complete remission (CR). The patient relapsed 6 months later, and second line therapy was unsuccessful. During this relapse, SNP microarray was performed on the diagnostic sample and identified amplification of 9q34 flanked by the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. Follow-up molecular studies confirmed a NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient was then started on dasatinib in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone.

TP53 C238Y	2517						Functional	Supports	D	Dominant Negative	This study evaluated the dominant negative potential of 103 p53 germline mutations contained in the IRAC database. The C238Y variant was considered severely deficient as cotransformation with empty vector resulted in poor transactivation of luciferase expression in 4 yeast strains compared to the p53 wildtype control vector (mean residual activity <25% of wildtype control). Cotransformation of C238Y and wildtype vectors led to the hinderance of luciferase expression below 90% compared to wildtype alone in all 4 yeast strains, which based on the authors criteria qualified the C238Y variant as dominant negative.	21343334	PubMed		Monti et al., 2011		2	accepted	7215	Rare Germline	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7215	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2517	false

Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017).	19903786	PubMed		He et al., 2009		3	accepted	7220	Somatic	2024-12-05 21:43:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7220	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5318	false

Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells.

Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling. The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.	30643249	PubMed		Gu et al., 2019		3	accepted	7291	Somatic	2023-11-07 08:28:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7291	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2566	true

Karyotype showed an abnormal clone characterized by the t(3;9)(p13;q34.1). This translocation has been shown previously to result in an abnormal fusion between the FOXP1 gene in 3p13 and the ABL1 in 9q34.1 (the fusion was not confirmed in this report by molecular methods). The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is known to be associated with Ph-like B-ALL subtype of B-ALL, although Ph-like expression profile was not demonstrated in this case report. The patient was treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) high-risk 4-drug induction chemotherapy with prednisone, daunorubicin, vincristine, and pegasparaginase and had 0.013% MRD at the end of indusciton. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib was added to the consolidation chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, peg-asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and vincristine.

v::NTRK1 Fusion	415	Lipofibromatosis-like Neural Tumor	0080894	Young adult onset,Childhood onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Among pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferating superficial lesions, lipofibromatosis (LPF), composed of an admixture of adipose tissue and fibroblastic elements, has been variously classified as infantile fibromatosis or fibrous hamartoma of infancy. A group of superficial soft tissue tumors occurring in children and young adults, with a notably infiltrative growth pattern reminiscent of LPF, variable cytologic atypia, and a distinct immunoprofile of S100 protein and CD34 reactivity, suggestive of neural differentiation, was described. To better characterize this group of LPF-like neural tumors (LPF-NT), genomic characterization (RNA sequencing) was performed, and revealed NTRK1 fusions (TPR::NTRK1 and TPM3::NTRK1) in two index cases and in 10/14 additional cases (using FISH). Of these 10, 4 had LMNA::NTRK1. No NTRK1-rearrangements were found in 25 classic LPF. NTRK1 immunostaining was found to be positive only in NTRK1 rearranged and S100 positive LPF-NT but negative in classic LPF. The authors suggest that NTRK1 oncogenic activation via gene fusion defines a new and distinct subset of soft tissue tumors similar to LPF, but with a neural immunophenotype (LPF-NT).	27259011	PubMed		Agaram et al., 2016		3	accepted	7293	Somatic	2024-08-29 23:58:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7293	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/415	false

Ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation in MV4-11 cell lines (growth inhibition: IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to native FLT3 in RS4;11 cell lines (IC50>100 nmol/L). Additionally, MV4-11 cell lines incubated for 1 hour were shown to have reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases beginning at a ponatinib concentration of 0.3 nmol/L. Ponatinib was shown to induce apoptotic mechanisms measured by caspase-3/7 activity in MV4-cell lines. In mice with the MV4-11 xenograft, ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation, as dosages of 1-5 mg/kg led to tumor growth inhibition and regression, while dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg led to complete tumor regression.

In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL.	19129520	PubMed		Mullighan et al., 2009		4	accepted	7383	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:02 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7383	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2613	false

The cells were tested for Ponatinib resistance. GIST-T1/816 cells containing del 560-578 and D816E mutations (IC50: 23 nM) did not show resistance towards Ponatinib compared to GIST-T1 cells with only del 560-578 mutation (IC50: 5 nM). Ponatinib reduced phosphorylation in KIT, AKT, and ERK at higher concentrations. According to the results, the authors suggest that Ponatinib remained highly active in GIST cell lines with secondary mutation D816E.	25239608	PubMed		Garner et al., 2014		4	accepted	7401	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:46 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7401	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1467	false

KIT A829P	964	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Ponatinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	D	Resistance	Ponatinib possesses potent activity against A829P KIT mutant cells in preclinical experiments. A preclinical study tested the effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on Ba/F3 cell lines with representative primary ponatinib-sensitizing mutation del 557-558, which induced IL-3 independent growth, and secondary mutation A829P. The cells were tested for Ponatinib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 and A829P mutations (IC50 for growth inhibition: 2 nM) did not show resistance towards Ponatinib compared to Ba/F3 cells with the del 557-558 mutation alone (IC50: 3 nM). Ponatinib was shown to inhibit KIT phosphorylation in moderate concentrations. Similarly, GIST-T1/829 cells with 560-578 deletion/A829P mutations (IC50 = 16 nM) were not resistant to Ponatinib compared to GIST T1 cells with 560-578 deletion alone (IC50 = 5 nM). Ponatinib inhibited phosphorylation in KIT, ERK, and AKT at moderate to high concentrations in GIST-T1/829 cells.	25239608	PubMed		Garner et al., 2014		4	accepted	7413	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7413	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/964	false

The cells were tested for Sunitinib and Imatinib resistances. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 and N822K mutations (Sunitinib IC50 for growth inhibition: 225 +- 19 nM, Imatinib IC50: 483 +- 24 nM) did show resistance towards Sunitinib and Imatinib compared to Ba/F3 cells with the del 557-558 alone (Sunitinib IC50: 7 +- 2 nM, Imatinib IC50: 27 +- 8 nM). Sunitinib and Imatinib did not completely inhibit KIT phosphorylation at 1000 nM, which was the highest concentration tested. Additionally, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Sunitinib and Imatinib separately. From these results, N822K mutations were the most frequent KIT mutation observed in resistant Ba/F3 cell populations incubated in Sunitinib. In Imatinib incubated cells, N822K mutations were seen in approximately 10% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones.	25239608	PubMed		Garner et al., 2014		4	accepted	7414	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7414	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1237	false

STAG2 MUTATION	665	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	In a retrospective cohort study of 389 uniformly treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 23 patients harbored mutations in genes of the cohesin complex including 5 who harbored mutations in STAG2. Mutation in the cohesin complex was not associated with worse overall survival (OS) or relapse free survival (RFS) compared to wildtype patients. The presence of STAG2 mutations had no influence on OS or RFS compared to wildtype (OS HR: 1.53, p = 0.4; RFS HR: 1.26, P = 0.7), though the authors note that the analysis was limited by the small number of patients. Authors speculate that co-occurring mutations in NPM1 may mask prognostic effects of STAG2 mutations.	24335498	PubMed		Thol et al., 2014	NCT00209833	2	accepted	7451	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7451	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/665	false

The S628N mutation was not present in the blood, which confirmed that it was a somatic mutation. After 3 months of imatinib treatment (300 mg/d for first three weeks, then 400 mg/d), the patient exhibited disease progression and increased tumor size, and after an additional three months of imatinib treatment (400 mg/d), the patient developed multiple supratentorial brain metastases in addition to increased lung metastases and died 5 days later. The authors reported preclinical data which indicated variant sensitivity to imatinib. although this outcome did not coroberate the preclinical result, the authors still concluded the variant may be sensitive.	25317746	PubMed		Vita et al., 2014		3	accepted	7463	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:47 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7463	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1567	false

Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status (N=341). PIK3CA mutation was determined according to the presence or absence of any hot spot mutation in the C2, helical, and kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exon 7, 9, and 20, respectively). In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.65, p<0.001). In the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the HR was 0.85. Analyses of PFS according to mutation types showed consistent benefit of treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant across prespecified subgroups, including E542K, E545X (N=105, HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1), and H1047X.	31091374	PubMed		André et al., 2019	NCT02437318	4	accepted	7468	Somatic	2024-10-28 17:37:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7468	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5296	false

GOPC::ROS1 Fusion	2639	Glioblastoma	3068		Lorlatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Ectopic expression of GOPC–ROS1 in Ba/F3 cells induced cytokine-independent growth whereas overexpression of ROS1 alone did not. Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA). Authors postulated that cell adhesion permitted sufficient to bypass survival signaling.	30171048	PubMed		Davare et al., 2018		3	accepted	7483	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:02 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7483	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2639	false

ATP1B1::NRG1 Fusion	2054	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	3498		Afatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were performed on 47 advanced PDAC patients. 3/47 patients were KRAS wildtype and all three of these cases harbored a NRG1 fusion. A 59-year-old metastatic PDAC patient harbored an in-frame fusion of exon 3 of ATP1B1 with exon 2 of NRG1 and no other observed clinically relevant small mutations. Compared to this PDAC cohort, significant overexpression of NRG1 (exons 2-7) was observed in the tumor. Of note, the EGF-like domain of NRG1 (exons 6 & 7), which is required for HER-family kinase activation, is preserved in the fusion. Treatment with afatinib resulted in significant clinical response as measured by imaging, as well as a drastic reduction in CA19-9 levels. Disease progression was noted 5.5 months after treatment initiation.	31068372	PubMed		Jones et al., 2019		3	accepted	7492	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:56 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7492	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2054	false

TP53 R248Q	117						Functional	Supports	D	Dominant Negative	CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to create five isogenic MOLM13-TP53 AML cell lines with combinations of wild-type, mutant, and null TP53 alleles at the endogenous locus: p53+/+, p53+/-, p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-. Cells were treated with and without DNA damaging agent and p53 inducing agent Daunorubicin and western blot used to assess p21 induction. p21 was induced in +/+ and +/-, but not -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells. Daunorubicin treatment caused less cell death in +/- than in +/+ cells, but induced significantly less death in -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-, where these three conditions were not statistically different. A similar result was seen with p53 activating agent Nutlin-3a, where p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells grouped together with equivalent resistance to the agent in comparison to +/+ and +/- cells. The grouping in results of -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- suggest that R248Q inactivates the wt p53 copy, which does not occur in the +/- condition.	31395785	PubMed		Boettcher et al., 2019		4	accepted	7525	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7525	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/117	false

BRAF A728V	1172						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	The BRAF mutation A728V (also known as A727V) resulted in elevated kinase activity relative to wild-type BRAF in vitro, as well as increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in COS cells. B-RAF activity was determined using kinase dead MEK as a substrate. A727V activity was 14 times higher than basal WT BRAF. The authors classified A727V activity as intermediate, since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells.	15035987	PubMed		Wan et al., 2004		2	accepted	7614	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:46:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7614	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1172	false

Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.	24215620	PubMed		Masuzawa et al., 2014		1	accepted	7744	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7744	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2547	false

CTNNB1 Exon 3 Mutation	2761	Desmoid Tumor	0080366				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study illustrates the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in sporadic desmoid tumors, and examines whether the presence of CTNNB1 mutations correlates with the disease outcome. CTNNB1 mutations (including specific exon 3 mutations T41A, S45F, S45P, and S45C) were found in 106 out of 145 desmoid tumor specimens, and in 86 out of 115 specimens from patients who had undergone complete surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the 5-year recurrence free survival rate of patients with the beta-catenin mutated tumors was worse than that of the patients with wild-type tumors (58% vs 74%), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.285). Thus, the study shows that there is no statistically significant correlation between the CTNNB1 mutation and the recurrence risk of sporadic desmoid tumors, even though specific exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations are commonly identified in these tumors.	23960186	PubMed		Mullen et al., 2013		4	accepted	7784	Somatic	2023-05-04 23:01:49 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7784	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2761	false

A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.	31871216	PubMed		Majounie et al., 2020		4	accepted	7787	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:03 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7787	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2762	false

The authors state that this is in line with experiments showing INNO-406 specifically inhibits LYN and LCK, which may provide a more favorable side effect profile than dasatinib, that was shown to strongly inhibit all 8 SRC family kinases.	18191450	PubMed		Deguchi et al., 2008		3	accepted	7874	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:03 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7874	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2786	false

PRPS1 A190T was detected only at relapse in 10 (8 Chinese; 2 German) cases, which all relapsed early while on therapy (Chinese 8/8, 100% vs. WT PRPS1 77/120 (64%); German 2/2 (100%) vs. WT PRPS1 79/214 (37%)). Based on protocols cited and the time to relapse, all 10 relapses harboring PRPS1 A190T were exposed to maintenance therapy that consisted of daily doses of thiopurine (mercaptopurine or thioguanine) treatment. A190T could drive clonal outgrowth through the promotion of thiopurine resistance.	25962120	PubMed		Li et al., 2015		3	accepted	7888	Somatic	2023-07-05 18:24:47 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7888	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2798	false

CHEK2 R474C c.1420C>T	2828	Cancer	162				Predisposing	Supports	C	Predisposition	Siblings (brother and sister) each were diagnosed with multiple primary lung cancer at the age of 60, along with various other cancers in their lifetimes. Homozygosity mapping revealed their parents (who also had cancer) had a consanguineous union. Each sibling was homozygous for CHEK2 R474C. The brother also had a son who died of neuroblastoma at 22 months of age. Amino acid R474 is highly conserved (98%) and forms a salt bridge in both the inactive and active CHEK2 homodimer. Modeling reveals R474C likely negatively affects the saltbridge and destabilizes the protein. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitation to overexpress CHEK2 WT or R474C in NIH3T3 cells revealed limited expression of R474C and limited activation through phosphorylation after UV exposure compared to the WT CHEK2 controls.

BCR::PDGFRA Fusion	2840	B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	0080638		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target.	12944919	PubMed		Trempat et al., 2003		3	accepted	7990	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7990	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2840	false
COL1A1::PDGFB Fusion	2841	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	3507		Sunitinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 37-year-old man presented with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis.	29760553	PubMed		Xiao et al., 2018		3	accepted	7991	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7991	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2841	false

ETV6::NTRK3 Fusion	779	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Late onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).	31905241	PubMed		Nardi et al., 2020		3	accepted	7993	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

A chronic-phase patient had a partial hematologic response with the Q252H and M351T variants present. The patient progressed to myeloid blast crisis (MBC) and was then negative for secondary variants. However, they had cytogenetic evidence of double Ph-chromosomes and later died. Another CP patient achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR). The Q252H variant was later detected but was absent when the patient progressed to myeloid blast crisis (MBC) at which time cytogenetic evidence of double Ph-chromosomes were present. The patient later died. An accelerated-phase patient had a complete hematologic response with the F359V and M351T variants present. The patient progressed to myeloid blast crisis at which point there were no secondary variants but cytogenetic evidence of double Ph-chromosomes.	12623848	PubMed		Branford et al., 2003		4	accepted	8093	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8093	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2878	false

FLT3 D835Y	2880	Cancer	162		Gilteritinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Gilteritinib inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y (IC50 1.6 nM; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4 nM) compared to controls (IC50 420nM; 95% CI: 350–500 nM). Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.	28516360	PubMed		Mori et al., 2017		4	accepted	8106	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8106	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2880	false

MYOD1 L122R	2901	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study evaluated forty-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (17 cases of alveolar RMS, 10 of embryonal RMS, 21 of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS, and a single case of a pleomorphic RMS) for MYOD1 (L122R), PIK3CA (H1047), and PIK3CA (E542/E545) variants. All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.	27562493	PubMed		Rekhi et al., 2016		4	accepted	8193	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8193	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2901	false

None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34).	27562493	PubMed		Rekhi et al., 2016		2	accepted	8194	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8194	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2901	false

EBF1::PDGFRB Fusion	531	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650		Imatinib,Chemotherapy	Combination	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 9 year old girl with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma (2016 WHO) relapsed 15 months post-maintenance chemotherapy. FISH and genomic analysis detected the EBF1-PDGFRB fusion (exon 11 with Exon14). The patient was treated with induction [fludarabine, idarubicin and cytarabine] therapy followed by additional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI, imatinib). Imatinib was stopped 10 days before cord blood transplant (CBT) with reduced intensity conditional and re-initiated on day 47 until 12 months post-transplant. The EBF1-PDGFRB transcript level measured using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remained below detection limit (<2.5x102 copies/ microgram RNA) for 36 months post CBT. Furthermore, the patient maintained molecular remission during the 24 months post-CBT and the 12 months following completion of TKI administration, based on minimal residual disease (MRD) testing conducted every 6 months.	32068648	PubMed		Sakurai et al., 2021		3	accepted	8260	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8260	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/531	false

The study found that dactolisib and lapatinib were effective in inhibiting outgrowth of PIK3CA amplified cells as monotherapies. Combination therapy produced similar abrogation of growth for PIK3CA amplified cells. Additionally, growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of lapatinib or dactolisib.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008		2	accepted	8271	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8271	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/212	false
PTEN Loss	214	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Trastuzumab		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	In a preclinical study, efficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy was evaluated in vitro against HER2 amplified human breast cancer cell line BT474 (heterozygous for PIK3CA K111N) with shRNA-induced PTEN expression loss. Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to trastuzumab as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among trastuzumab treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT (S473 and T308) was higher in PTEN knockdown cells compared to PTEN expression cells, by western blot.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008		2	accepted	8274	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8274	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false

Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to lapatinib as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among lapatinib treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT and ERK was substantially higher in cells with PTEN loss compared to PTEN expressing cells, by western blot. Furthermore, athymic nude mice injected with PTEN non-expressing BT474 cells had significantly higher mean tumor volume following lapatinib monotherapy compared to mice injected with PTEN expressing BT474. Authors conclude that loss of PTEN expression confers resistance to lapatinib in HER2 positive breast cancer cells.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008		4	accepted	8275	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8275	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false

PTEN loss resulted in partial rescue from the strong dactolisib induced reduction of colony formation that was seen in BT474 cells with unperturbed PTEN. Among cells treated with dactolisib (100nmol/L), those lacking PTEN expression demonstrated higher concentrations of phosphorylated AKT (S473) and phosphorylated ERK compared to PTEN expressing cells.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008		2	accepted	8276	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8276	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false

Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to lapatinib, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect. Western blot analysis of lapatinib and dactolisib combination treated cells showed a decrease in phosphorylated AKT and S6 relative to untreated and lapatinib treated control cells. Authors concluded that addition of dactolisib to lapatinib overcame PTEN loss induced lapatinib resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008		2	accepted	8278	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8278	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false

MYOD1 L122R	2901	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study examined 17 cases of spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (SC/SRMS) for the presence of MYOD1 variants. 12 cases harbored a MYOD-1 mutation, of which 8 cases were homozygous for p.L122R, 3 were heterozygous for p.L122R, and 1 was heterozygous for a novel p.E118K variant. There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received. This supports aggressive clinical course for SC/SRMS positive for MYOD-1 variants, regardless of the presence of a concurrent PIK3CA mutation.	30604891	PubMed		Tsai et al., 2019		3	accepted	8313	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8313	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2901	false

ETV6::NTRK3 Fusion	779	Congenital Fibrosarcoma	8418				Diagnostic	Supports	A	Positive	This is the first study showing the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion in congenital fibrosarcoma (CFS). Using cytogenetic and FISH analyses, a novel t(12;15)(p13;q25) rearrangement was identified in CFS cases (3 of 4, including 1 case likely presenting overgrowth of normal fibroblasts). Mapping of breakpoints and mRNA analysis revealed that the translocation gives rise to the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript, consisting of the HLH dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the kinase domain of NTRK3. This aberration was absent in adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS, 2 cases) and infantile fibromatosis (IFB, 15 cases). This is the first study describing the involvement of NTRK proteins in human oncogenesis and ETV6 gene fusion in solid tumors and proposing ETV6-NTRK3 as a diagnostic biomarker for CFS.	9462753	PubMed		Knezevich et al., 1998		4	accepted	8332	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8332	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

All 35 patients had VHL germline mutations and were assessed for the presence of pheochromocytoma and renal carcinoma in addition to pancreatic tumours. The presence of other phenotypes was not described. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and mutations were detected using direct sequencing of the 3 exons of VHL and/or southern blot analysis. A germline missense mutation (c.256C>T) was found in 3 patients, 2 of which were related. Patient No 7 from family 503 presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour, pheochromocytoma, and renal carcinoma and patient No 15 from family 503 presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour. Their familial relation was not described. Patient No. 27 from family 11 also had the same mutation and presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour, pheochromocytoma, and renal carcinoma. The patients' phenotypes are highly specific to VHL disease (ACMG PP4).	18580449	PubMed		Corcos et al., 2008		3	accepted	8771	Rare Germline	2023-01-09 21:46:52 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8771	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1778	false
KRAS Mutation	332	Ovary Serous Adenocarcinoma	5744		Binimetinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Post hoc analysis of a randomized phase 3 trial (MILO/ENGOT-ov11) suggests a possible association between KRAS mutation and response to binimetinib in patients with pretreated (1-3 lines of prior chemotherapy) recurrent or persistent Low-Grade Serous Carcinomas of the Ovary, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneum. Of 133 binimetinib-treated patients with individual response and molecular data, 46 harbored KRAS mutations. KRAS mutation status was significantly associated with local best response (P=0.004); 44% of patients with KRAS mutation versus 19% of patients with KRAS WT had CR or PR in the binimetinib arm. KRAS mutation was also associated with prolonged PFS in patients treated with binimetinib (median PFS: KRAS mutant: 17.7 months; KRAS wild-type (WT): 10.8 months; P = .006), but not in patients receiving standard chemotherapy (physicians' choice, median PFS: KRAS mutant: 14.6 months; KRAS WT: 11.5 months; P=.502).	32822286	PubMed		Monk et al., 2020	NCT01849874	3	accepted	8773	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8773	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false
KRAS Wildtype	3069	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Regorafenib		Predictive	Does Not Support	D	Resistance	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS wildtype did not demonstrate resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 114.28 nM) compared to SW48 cells expressing various common KRAS G12/G13 mutations. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers. Authors concluded that KRAS wildtype was not resistant to regorafenib compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.	26161928	PubMed		Camaj et al., 2015		2	accepted	8840	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:06 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8840	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3069	true

Steady state competition surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated a ~177 fold decrease in venetoclax affinity for G101V (Ki=3.2nM) versus WT (Ki=.018nM). Resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect in the P2 pocket of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152 as affinity for venetoclax was restored in BCL2 G101V through the introduction of an E152A mutation (Ki =.002nM). Additionally, BCL2 G101V maintains similar affinity for apoptotic BH3 peptides, which assists in the prevention of apoptosis.	31160589	PubMed		Birkinshaw et al., 2019		3	accepted	8841	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8841	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2829	false

FGFR3 S249C	624	Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma	4006				Oncogenic	Supports	D	Oncogenicity	In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.	16338952	PubMed		Bernard-Pierrot et al., 2006		4	accepted	8853	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8853	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/624	false
FGFR3 S249C	624						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.	25606676	PubMed		Del Piccolo et al., 2015		3	accepted	8854	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8854	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/624	false

At confluence, Human TERT-NHUC cells stably expressing S249C displayed a multilayered appearance, reduced cell-cell adhesion, formed ridges, and increased saturation density compared to controls. Additionally, cell cycle analysis demonstrated S249C cells were significantly more viable (p<.001) at confluence and fewer S249C cells were in G0/G1 than controls. Western blots also showed confluent S249C had increased levels of cell cycle and cell survival proteins. Unlike wildtype FGFR3, S249C displayed constitutive activation independent from the presence of ligand.	19749790	PubMed		di Martino et al., 2009		3	accepted	8855	Somatic	2024-08-02 21:48:17 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8855	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/624	false

With immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunoblotting (IB) experiments, they demonstrated constitutional phosphorylation of FGFR3 Y373C protein. Then with SU5492 (an FGFR3 TKI) and FGFR3 siRNA, they also demonstrate that constitutional phosphorylation of the FGFR3 Y373C can be inhibited. Furthermore, cells treated with SU5492 (for inhibition) and FGFR3 siRNA (for depletion) of the mutant FGFR3 Y373C protein show inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth.

In multivariate analysis, among metastatic fusion positive ARMS, PAX7-FOXO1 fusion was not significantly associated with increased risk of failure or death. Further, among PAX7-FOXO1 fusion patients, there was little difference in outcome whether patients presented with loco-regional or metastatic disease, in striking contrast with PAX3-FOXO1 fusion positive patients. The authors concluded that PAX7-FOXO1 fusion is an independent indicator of favorable outcome in metastatic ARMS.	12039929	PubMed		Sorensen et al., 2002		3	accepted	8886	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8886	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2456	false
LMNA::NTRK1 Fusion	1252	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Entrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.	26563355	PubMed		Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2016		4	accepted	8900	Somatic	2023-07-13 19:32:46 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8900	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1252	false

Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.	24445538	PubMed		Wiesner et al., 2014		3	accepted	8903	Somatic	2023-07-13 19:32:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8903	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1252	false

ETV6::NTRK3 Fusion	779	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Juvenile onset	Larotrectinib,Etoposide,Methotrexate	Combination	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.	31725893	PubMed		Schewe et al., 2019		4	accepted	8917	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8917	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false
FLT3 ITD	55	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.	27908881	PubMed		Lee et al., 2017		3	accepted	8923	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8923	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/55	false
FLT3 ITD	55	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).	28516360	PubMed		Mori et al., 2017		4	accepted	8924	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8924	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/55	false

Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice.

CIC::DUX4 Fusion	3121	CIC-rearranged Sarcoma	0081250	Adult onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study consists of a cohort of 115 patients with a class of sarcomas that had similar morphology to Ewing sarcoma. The presence of a CIC rearrangement was detected in all the cases by FISH. Previously, it was unclear whether this class of sarcomas should be classified as a separate entity or be classified as a variant of Ewing sarcoma. CIC-rearranged sarcomas showed a male predominance with an average age of 32 years old. A CIC::DUX4 fusion was found by additional FISH testing for DUX4 loci in 57% of the cases, with either a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 19 or between chromosomes 10 and 19. 57 patients were followed clinically and showed a 5-year survival rate of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival rate of Ewing sarcoma patients (p=0.002). In histologic evaluation, stromal myxoid change was a common finding in CIC-positive tumors, while this is not usually found in Ewing sarcoma. CIC-positive tumors showed a diffuse CD99 immunohistochemical staining pattern in only 23% of the cases, in contrast to that found in Ewing sarcoma, which showed a diffuse CD99 staining pattern in almost all of the cases. Therefore, this study provides evidence that sarcomas that contain CIC::DUX4 fusion should be considered a separate entity, distinct from Ewing sarcoma.	28346326	PubMed		Antonescu et al., 2017		4	accepted	9012	Somatic	2024-02-12 19:12:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9012	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3121	false
BRAF V600E	12	Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma	3969		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).	27460442	PubMed		Brose et al., 2016	NCT01286753	4	accepted	9018	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9018	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false

ETV6::ABL1 Fusion	2448	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study determined the incidence, clinical characteristics and associated genetic abnormalities in hematologic malignancies with the ETV6-ABL1 fusion. The total of 44 new and previously published ETV6-ABL1 positive cases were detected and characterized using conventional cytogenetics, FISH, RT-PCR, SNP/copy number arrays, expression arrays and a custom Taqman 'low-density array' (LDA card). Among the 44 cases, there were 22 cases of B-ALL (13 children, 9 adults), and 22 myeloid malignancies (18 myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 4 acute myeloid leukemias). The 9 ETV6-ABL1 positive ALL cases (7 diagnosis and 2 relapse samples) that underwent whole genome expression profiling displayed similar expression profiles to the BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia cohort. Also, 9/10 ETV6-ABL1 BCP-ALL cases were classified by custom Taqman assay (designed to detect BCR-ABL1-like expression signature) as BCR-ABL1-like. The study thus shows that in B-ALL, the presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion correlates with the BCR-ABL1 like (Ph-like) subtype of the disease.	27229714	PubMed		Zaliova et al., 2016		4	accepted	9073	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9073	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2448	false

FISH using a BCR-ABL1 probe demonstrated 50-80 extrachromosomal copies of ABL1; FISH using probes to the 3' regions of ABL1 and NUP214 confirmed NUP214-ABL1 amplification in ~99% of cells. The NUP214-ABL1 amplification was also confirmed by MLPA and SNP6.0 analysis. Additionally, this patient harbored a focal deletion of IKZF1 (exons 2-7) and CDKN2A/B (exons 1-2). Day 29 marrow showed complete morphological remission; however PCR-based IgVH MRD rearrangement studies revealed clonal IgVH rearrangement (1 in 10^4 cells). Patient underwent sibling donor allogenic stem cell transplant, and at 4 months is in complete remission. NUP214-ABL1 positive patient primary cells were cultured with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib). After 72-hour culture there was no significant reduction in viable cell numbers or increase in apoptosis, when compared to the no drug control. The in vitro sensitivity to TKIs may be attributed to variable NUP214-ABL1 copy number and/or focal deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B.	23175662	PubMed		Eyre et al., 2012		2	accepted	9150	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9150	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2529	false
ZMIZ1::ABL1 Fusion	3138	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Childhood onset			Oncogenic	Supports	C	Oncogenicity	A 18-month-old female with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chromosome and FISH analysis using a BCR-ABL1 probe confirmed the involvement of ABL1 in a t(9;10)(q34;q22.3) translocation. Follow-up molecular analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of a ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript (ZMIZ1 exon 14 and ABL1 exon 2). Patient was treated according to standard risk protocol without kinase inhibitors and is in first complete remission. Authors note that The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript predicts the the synthesis of ZMIZ1-ABL fusion protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that promotes cellular transformation. The authors further note that patients with t(9;10) would be eligible for imatinib treatment.	18007576	PubMed		Soler et al., 2008		1	accepted	9151	Somatic	2023-02-03 19:55:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9151	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3138	false
ZMIZ1::ABL1 Fusion	3138	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650	Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	Study comprised 574 children with newly diagnosed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) and focused on B-other/BCR-ABL-like which were identified by hierarchical clustering of gene expression data. RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing for detection of tyrosine kinase fusions was performed for 153 cases. There were 14 fusions found among the BCR-ABL-like cases (14/77=18%), which included one case with a ZMIZ1-ABL1 (exon 18 and exon 2). ZMIZ1-AML1 fusion was among a group of nine fusions found, and characterized by the authors as predictive for activated ABL signaling. The 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the fusion-positive BCR-ABL1-like group (35%) was comparable to the fusion-negative BCR-ABL1-like group (35%), and worse than non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other group (17%, p=0.07).	27894077	PubMed		Boer et al., 2017		2	accepted	9152	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9152	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3138	false

Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1 including 1 case with LSM14A-ABL1. The patient with LSM14A-ABL1 was a 36 year old male who also had a IKZF1 intragenic deletion. He had a poor prednisone response and did not reach complete remission after vincristine-dexamethasone-rituximab or a combination of dasatinib and chemotherapy, although some of the patients in this case series appeared to benefit from the introduction of TKIs. The patient died early of sepsis in a context of uncontrolled disease (survival 2 months).	31434701	PubMed		Tanasi et al., 2019		2	accepted	9153	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9153	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3141	false
SFPQ::ABL1 Fusion	3156	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Late young adult onset,Intermediate young adult onset			Oncogenic	Supports	C	Oncogenicity	The authors describe two cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(1;9)(p34;q34) rearrangement, resulting in a fusion between the pre-mRNA processing protein gene SFPQ and the ABL1 kinase gene. Patient 1 was a 19-year old female patient with common B-cell ALL expressing 2 myeloid markers. Due to the presence of the 2 myeloid markers, she was treated with a classic acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) induction regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin), along with imatinib due to the involvement of the ABL1 locus. Patient achieved complete remission, followed by a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, a non-familial allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a dose-reduced conditioning, and a maintenance treatment with dasatinib. Complete remission was maintained 32 months after the allograft. Patient 2 was a 28 year old female, diagnosed with common B-ALL (EGIL B-II), and was included in the GRAALL 2005 protocol with intensified cyclophosphamide administration, and was corticosensitive but chemoresistant (60% blasts at day 8). She achieved complete remission after the induction regimen, and this was followed by consolidation regimen with cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. After this, familial allograft with her brother as donor was performed, and she remained in complete remission 18 months after allograft. FISH and sequencing have confirmed the fusion between SFPQ-ex9 and ABL-ex4 in both patients. The authors conclude that the t(1;9)(p34;q34), fusing SFPQ in 1p34 with ABL1 in 9q34, represents a recurrent abnormality in B-ALL.	21388681	PubMed		Duhoux et al., 2011		3	accepted	9158	Somatic	2023-02-03 19:55:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9158	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3156	false
SFPQ::ABL1 Fusion	3156	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Late young adult onset	Dasatinib,Imatinib	Sequential	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with break-apart probes, the authors screened retrospectively 55 pediatric and 50 adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases negative for common drivers (B-other) for rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2 and PDGFRB tyrosine kinase genes. Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL.	32306475	PubMed		Biloglav et al., 2020		3	accepted	9159	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9159	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3156	false

Physical examination revealed multiple and superficial lymph nodes. Peripheral blood counting showed a 47% blasts. Bone marrow aspirates showed marked hypercellularity and 72.5% blasts, but no Auer body. Karyotype analysis showed a t(1;9)(p34;q34), resulting in a SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. After two courses of VDP induction chemotherapy containing vindesine, daunorubicin, and prednisone, the patient achieved CR with 1.5% blasts in bone marrow. Unfortunately, the patient relapsed with 55% blasts in bone marrow in February 2014. Eventually, the patient died from disease progression.	27894117	PubMed		Sheng et al., 2017		3	accepted	9160	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9160	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3156	false
SFPQ::ABL1 Fusion	3156	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Intermediate young adult onset			Oncogenic	Supports	C	Oncogenicity	A 22-year-old male presenting with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) characterized by a t(1;9)(p34;q34) was found to carry an SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The fusion was confirmed by amplification of the genomic breakpoints and RT-PCR; it was shown to be in-frame and to encode the N-terminal domain of the SFPQ-encoded protein and the entire tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminal sequences of the ABL1 kinase. The SFPQ (Splicing Factor Proline And Glutamine Rich) gene, encoding a protein that specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts in pre-mRNA and regulates signal-induced alternative splicing, was thus described as a new 5’ partner of the ABL1 gene in B-ALL.	18205209	PubMed		Hidalgo-Curtis et al., 2008		2	accepted	9161	Somatic	2023-02-03 19:43:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9161	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3156	false

RCSD1::ABL1 Fusion	2550	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Middle age onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Authors reported a 40-yr-old male patient with pre-B ALL and t(1;9)(q24;q34) translocation. Two different RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcripts, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, were identified, one consisting of the first three exons of RCSD1 fused to ABL1 starting from exon 4, the second of the first two exons of RCSD1 fused to exon 4 of ABL1. The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy. The patient successfully reentered in CCyR, which has been maintained with dasatinib monotherapy for more than nine months.	19794096	PubMed		Mustjoki et al., 2009		3	accepted	9164	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9164	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2550	false
RCSD1::ABL1 Fusion	2550	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Juvenile onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Authors reported a 15-year-old female patient with B-ALL diagnosed in June 2014. Conventional cytogenetics and FISH identified t(1;9)(q23;q34) and RCSD1ABL1 fusion. Microarray identified an approximately 70 kb deletion at 7p12.2 disrupting the IKZF1 gene. The patient was enrolled on AALL-1131 and received a 4-drug induction therapy with Vincristine/Daunorubicin/Pegaspargase/Prednisone. Her day 8 peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing showed 18–25% blasts and her day 29 bone marrow evaluation revealed induction failure. She continued chemotherapy per the very high-risk control arm of AALL-1131 with the addition of dasatinib due to the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion. Her consolidation course was complicated due to presumed fungal infection and C. difficile colitis, but she was able to complete the consolidation treatment. The last bone marrow done on November 2014 showed no evidence of persistent/recurrent leukemia. The patient had a bone marrow transplant from a sibling in November 2014, but a few weeks after transplant she developed severe sepsis as well as capillary leak syndrome. She remained admitted to the intensive care unit where she unfortunately died on March 12, 2015.	26600955	PubMed		Kamran et al., 2015		2	accepted	9165	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9165	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2550	false

RT-PCR and sequence analyses detected transcription of a single RCSD1-ABL1 fusion gene variant, which had breakpoints in exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1. The patient was treated with hyper-CVAD combination without achieving complete remission (CR). Therefore, the patient was treated with combination chemotherapy comprising 800 mg of imatinib for 7 days and 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days followed by 140 mg of dasatinib daily. On day 74, lymphoblasts disappeared from the peripheral blood, but 15% remained in the bone marrow. A second course of hyper-CVAD with 140 mg of dasatinib daily was administered. Twenty days after therapy using 1.5 g of methotrexate and cytarabine (total dose; 18 g), lymphoblasts suddenly increased by 82%. Administration of 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days was highly effective in reducing lymphoblast count. Administration of triplicated dexamethasone and dasatinib achieved stable disease with partial remission in the bone marrow. However, during the seventh administration of dexamethasone, the disease recurred and there was no further response to treatment.	21863287	PubMed		Inokuchi et al., 2011		3	accepted	9166	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9166	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2550	false

RCSD1::ABL1 Fusion	2550	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Late onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Authors reported a 61-year old female diagnosed with B-ALL in August 2012. The RCSD1-ABL1 t(1;9)(q22;q34) fusion between exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1 was identified by RT-PCR. The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully. Since then, there is an ongoing remission that, to date, has lasted 30 months.	28057740	PubMed		Frech et al., 2017		3	accepted	9168	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9168	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2550	false

BRAF V600E	12	Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma	3969				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Clinical study including 219 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) to determine a correlation between the BRAF V600E mutation and poor oncological outcome. This study found that 107 of the 219 (49%) patients had this mutation signifying that the BRAF V600E mutation is one of the most commonly occurring among PTC patients. This cohort was split into two groups—BRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients. The authors conclude that PTC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation have worse clinicopathological outcomes, and that the BRAF mutation can be used to assess risk stratification in patients with PTC.	16174717	PubMed		Xing et al., 2005		4	accepted	9170	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9170	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false
ETV6::ABL1 Fusion	2448	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 4-year-old female presented with relapsed B-cell precursor ALL and no MLL or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement per cytogenetic studies. During multiple periods of short remission and relapse she was treated with high risk induction chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation and matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Finally, WES and RNA-seq were performed on the tumor and normal samples, which identified a cryptic ETV6-ABL1 fusion as well as a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. She was administered imatinib and achieved a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission, which were maintained for 18 months. After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D). Treatments of Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Panobinostat were unsuccessful and the patient ultimately succumbed to her disease 7 year after her initial diagnosis.	30028819	PubMed		Mankuzhy et al., 2019		3	accepted	9171	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9171	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2448	false
SNX2::ABL1 Fusion	2547	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650	Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	This retrospective study intended to clarify clinical characteristics of patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) and kinase fusions that are not well described (excluding ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and BCR-ABL). The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.	27176795	PubMed		Imamura et al., 2016		3	accepted	9177	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9177	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2547	false

Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.	25207766	PubMed		Roberts et al., 2014		3	accepted	9178	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9178	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2547	false
RANBP2::ABL1 Fusion	3137	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650	Young adult onset	Dasatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This retrospective study reported the outcome of 24 patients with Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) harboring ABL-class fusions, who were treated with a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1; in 7/12 patients the ABL1 fusion was detected at diagnosis, and in 5/12 it was identified at relapse. One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3). However, the patient experienced another relapse and died of progressive disease. The case illustrates partial response to TKIs in combination with chemotherapy in a relapsed Ph-like B-ALL with RANBP2-ABL1 fusion.	31434701	PubMed		Tanasi et al., 2019		2	accepted	9211	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9211	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3137	false
PPP2R1A P179R	3167						Functional	Supports	D	Loss of Function	Immunoprecipitation experiments in a serous endometrial carcinoma cell line that expressed V5 tagged PPP2R1A P179R protein revealed that binding of PPP2R1A to the PP2A holoenzyme complex members was significantly reduced for PPP2R1A P179R compared to wildtype protein. In vitro reconstitution of the PPP2A holoenzyme was also inhibited by PPP2R1A P179R. Crystal structures of the mutant and wildtype proteins revealed changes in PPP2R1A protein structural conformation that impacts the interaction with the PPP2CA C-subunit, and increases the binding energy between the PPP2R1A and PPP2CA subunits from 236 to 347 kJ/mol for wildtype and mutant protein, respectively. Cell lines that expressed PPP2R1A P179R had increased proteosome-mediated degradation of the PPP2CA (C-subunit), PPP2R2A (B55α) and PPP2R5A (B56α) subunits. Together, this evidence points to PPP2R1A P179R mediated disruption of the PPP2A complex.	31142515	PubMed		Taylor et al., 2019		4	accepted	9212	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9212	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3167	false

Sequencing showed that RCSD1 exon 3 was fused to ABL1 exon 4. This patient was treated with chemotherapy and HSC transplant and relapsed. Ex vivo drug response profiling (DRP) of the patient leukemic blasts was performed at first relapse. Resistance and/or low response were observed for dasatinib and nilotinib, and measurable responses were noted to ponatinib. This differential response to ponatinib as compared with dasatinib was confirmed in a secondary dose-response study and in mice inoculated with leukemia cells. Then the patient was started on ponatinib monotherapy (45 mg/day) based on her RCSD1-ABL1 fusion and achieved a remission. She received a second HSC transplant but relapsed at day 77 post transplantation. Ponatinib was restarted at this time that resulted in response but didn’t reach remission. The patient died of a septic shock 2 weeks later.	25768406	PubMed		Collette et al., 2015		3	accepted	9213	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9213	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2550	false
CHD7::BEND2 Fusion	4244	Pancreatic Endocrine Carcinoma	1798				Oncogenic	Supports	C	Oncogenicity	A 35 year-old patient presented with a grade 3 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and liver metastasis. Whole genome sequencing and RNAseq revealed a previously undescribed somatic translocation between Chromosome 8 and X (t(8;X)(q12.2;p22.13)), which produces an in-frame CHD7::BEND2 fusion (exon 2 and exon 5). RNA-seq results showed increased expression of BEND2 downstream from the fusion breakpoints, indicating its enhanced expression. The authors hypothesize that activation of BEND2, either by fusion or increased expression, may promote oncogenic activity.	31160355	PubMed		Williamson et al., 2019	NCT02155621	1	accepted	9219	Somatic	2023-08-25 16:44:45 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9219	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4244	false

ATRX Deletion	3177	Cancer	162		Cisplatin,Fluorouracil	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Transgenic mice were generated with conditional knockouts affecting exon 18 of the mouse ATRX gene, previously shown to be an equivalent of a loss of function. Macrophages derived from the knockout mice were significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (P<0.05) compared to macrophages derived from wild-type mice, as demonstrated by reduced survival by TUNEL assays. Re-introduction of ATRX rescued cells from 5-FU treatment. Similar significant (P<0.05) increases in TUNEL-positive cells were seen for ATRX-deficient neurons treated with 5-FU, as well as myoblasts and embryonic fibroblasts treated with 5-FU or cisplatin. The authors conclude that ATRX loss leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.	23284920	PubMed		Conte et al., 2012		3	accepted	9239	N/A	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9239	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3177	false

TP53 P250L	3186						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	In a pre-clinical study, wild-type and P250L TP53 were transiently overexpressed in the human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cell line, which lacks endogenous p53. Immunofluorescence revealed that the P250L mutant cell line had reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic staining as compared to the wildtype. The punctate staining suggested that the P250L mutant forms large aggregates within the perinucleus. Chemical disruption of the microtubule assembly resulted in a shift from punctate to diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the P250L cell line. The oligomerization state of the wild type and P250L p53 was analyzed using Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and western blot analysis: It was found that the wild type p53 appeared as monomers, tetramers and octamers while the P250L p53 formed large masses. More importantly, it was found that the formation of these aggregates by the P250L mutant could lead to co-aggregation of the wild-type p53, causing dominant negative activity. Additionally, the P250L mutant was found to inactivate the p53 paralogs, p63 and p73, while upregulating HSP70 and HSP90.	21445056	PubMed		Xu et al., 2011		5	accepted	9285	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:47:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9285	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3186	false

The patient was treated with Ceritinib as a monotherapy for 7.5 months. The residual primary decreased in size (44% volume reduction at 6 months of treatment) and was surgically removed. At 21 months of followup a complete remission was observed (including all metastatic sites).	29907598	PubMed		Guan et al., 2018		4	accepted	9404	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9404	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3239	false
EZH2 Y646	165						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	Using a baculovirus expression system, wild-type EZH2 or Y641 (Y641F, Y641H, Y641N, Y641S) mutants were coexpressed with the PRC2 complex in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Methyltransferase activity assays showed that the Y641 mutants were more effective than the wildtype in catalyzing dimethyl to trimethyl reactions. In comparison to the wildtype, the enzyme turnover and catalytic efficiency for the mutants was lower for the non methylated and monomethylated substrates, and higher for dimethylated substrates. Western blots of patient derived lymphoma cell lines (one homozygous wildtype and four heterozygous Y641 mutant lines) supported steady state enzyme kinetic predictions where the homozygous wildtype line demonstrated increased me1 and me2, but decreased 3me at H3K27. Alternatively, the heterozygous lines displayed increased 3me but decreased me1 and me2 at H3K27. These results suggest both the wildtype and Y641 mutants contribute to trimethylation and therefore the altered expression signature.	21078963	PubMed		Sneeringer et al., 2010		3	accepted	9412	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9412	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/165	false
PIK3R2 G373R	3249						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	Lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from patients with megalencephaly syndromes, who had the PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. PIP3 immunostaining was used to compared PI3K activity among mutant and control cell lines. The mutant cell line had increased PIP3 levels compared to the control, pointing to increased PI3K activity, since PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3. Use of PI3K inhibitor, PI-103, led to reduction of PIP3 levels in the mutant cell line, suggesting that the impact of the PIK3R2 mutation on PIP3 levels depends on PI3K.	22729224	PubMed		Rivière et al., 2012		1	accepted	9420	Rare Germline	2023-01-09 21:47:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9420	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3249	false
PTEN C136R	3250						Functional	Supports	D	Loss of Function	In PHTS-derived lymphoblasts, PTEN protein expression, PTEN mRNA levels, and proteasome activity was measured in the PTEN C136R and control cells. In PTEN-C136R cells, PTEN protein expression was significantly reduced, PTEN mRNA levels was comparable to wildtype(wt), and proteasome activity was 30% greater than wt. This increased proteasomal activity was also found in MCF-7 and HEK-293 cell lines transfected with C136R-PTEN, and in mice expressing C136R-PTEN. Further experiments found the mutant localizes to the cytosol, where its increased proteasomal activity is observed. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of MCF-7 cells expressing wt or C136R-PTEN revealed this mutant to be highly unstable. Using P-AKT and P-ERK as markers of PI3K and MAPK pathway activity, respectively, it was found that C136R-PTEN resulted in increased fold change of both, inferring increased pathway activation. The authors further inferred that the mutant results in impaired PTEN lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase.	23475934	PubMed		He et al., 2013		3	accepted	9421	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:47:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9421	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3250	false

There was no difference of H3K27Me2 and H3K9Me3 levels between Y641F/N and WT, indicating specificity in a gain of function of Y641F/N. Expression of Y641F mutation in HEK293T cells with wild-type EZH2 led to an increase in H3K27me3. Primary murine B-cell lines with Y641F mutation also showed an increase of H3K27me3. Structural modeling indicated that Y641F/N helped push the equilibrium to favor trimethylated products. A 3H methyl incorporation assay was used to study the activity of the PRC2 complex containing Y641F mutation in vitro. PRC2 complexes containing Y641F showed nearly two times higher activity with H3K27me2 substrates than PRC complexes with wild-type EZH2.

BRAF G463E	3300	Cancer	162				Oncogenic	Supports	D	Oncogenicity	The BRAF mutation G463E resulted in elevated kinase activity relative to wild-type BRAF in vitro. B-RAF activity was determined using kinase dead MEK as a substrate. G463E activity was 28 times higher than basal WT BRAF. The authors classified G463E activity as intermediate since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells. NIH3T3 transformation assay yielded 24 +/- 14 foci/ng of transfected BRAF DNA, in comparison to WT, which yielded zero foci, indicating an oncogenic effect of BRAF G463E.	15035987	PubMed		Wan et al., 2004		3	accepted	9527	Unknown	2023-02-21 18:37:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9527	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3300	false

The G31A mutation did not lead to tumor formation in the pooled assay but did cause tumor formation in 6/6 mice in the individual experiment. The NFE2L2:p.G31A allele was also found to be expressed at significantly higher levels as compared to wild type. Short term gene expression correlation analysis was also completed using HA1E cells and the L1000 Luminex bead-based gene expression assay. Transcript level of 978 landmark genes were measured to formulate a gene expression signature for the allele. Overexpression of the mutant allele led to a similar signature as overexpression of the wild type, suggesting that the gain-of-function changes induced by the mutant can also be seen in NFE2L2-overexpressed cells.	27147599	PubMed		Kim et al., 2016		3	accepted	9574	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:47:09 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9574	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3325	false

LMNA::NTRK1 Fusion	1252	Solid Tumor			Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.	30624546	PubMed		Hong et al., 2019	NCT02122913	3	accepted	9588	Somatic	2024-02-05 21:08:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9588	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1252	false

TP53 ALTERATION	1281	Rhabdomyosarcoma	3247	Young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study evaluated 641 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that were enrolled in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trials from 1998 to 2017 and the UK malignant mesenchymal tumor and RMS2005 trails from 1995 to 2016. Molecular testing included 39 genes which had been implicated in the past with regards to RMS. The analysis was performed with a custom-capture sequencing assay. Altered TP53 was noted in 69 out of 515 FOXO1 fusion-negative RMS cases (13%), with the most frequent mutations at codons G245S (6 cases), R248Q or W (6 cases), R175H (4 cases), and P72A (4 cases). These cases displayed a worse event free survival. In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin. Nevertheless, both cohorts show that mutations in TP53 are associated with a poor prognosis in both fusion-negative and fusion-positive RMS, with a particularly bleak outcome in fusion-positive RMS.	34166060	PubMed		Shern et al., 2021		4	accepted	9594	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9594	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1281	false

NUP98::NSD1 Fusion	2466	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119	Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In this study >1000 well-characterized pediatric and adult AML cases were screened using a NUP98/NSD1-specific RT-PCR. In the pediatric cohort (n = 293; age, 0-18 years), NUP98/NSD1 was present in 16.1% of the cases. The authors identified the cytogenetically cryptic NUP98/NSD1 translocation as an independent factor for dismal clinical outcome for both pediatric and adult patients. The remission rate (CR) of NUP98/NSD1-positive cases in the pediatric cohort was 100%, but 10 of the 12 cases relapsed early. The cumulative incidence of nonresponse/relapse (pCIR) at 4 years was 83 ± 13% for NUP98/NSD1-positive versus 45 ± 3% for negative cases (P < .001). NUP98/NSD1 cases had a poor event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) (4-years pEFS, 8 ± 8% vs 46 ± 3%, P < .001; and 4-years pOS, 31 ± 16% vs 64 ± 3%, P = .011 for NUP98/NSD1-positive vs negative cases, respectively).	21813447	PubMed		Hollink et al., 2011		4	accepted	9720	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9720	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2466	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Childhood Ependymoma	5509		Lapatinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	From a phase one clinical trial, pediatric patients with refractory CNS malignancies were administered 300-1150 mg/m2 twice daily of ERBB2 and EGFR inhibitor lapatinib. The maximum-tolerated dose was established at 900 mg/m2 twice daily, regardless of steroid use. From the 59 patients, 12 patients, including 5 diagnosed with ependymoma, demonstrated a prolonged stable disease in response to lapatinib. In comparison to other CNS tumors, pretrial samples from patients with ependymoma tumors displayed high expression of ERBB2 and activation of ERBB2 signaling. Due to the high expression of ERBB2 receptors, targeting ERBB2 may be a viable treatment for patients with ependymoma tumors and other high expressing ERBB2 brain tumors.	20713864	PubMed		Fouladi et al., 2010		1	accepted	9778	N/A	2023-02-03 15:55:46 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9778	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

The assay identified COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcripts in all but one DFSP case, which was consistent with concurrent FISH testing on the same samples. The study concluded that COL1A1-PDGFB rearrangements appear more prevalent in DFSP (96%) than previously reported. The use of sensitive molecular assays for detection of COL1A1-PDGFB fusion may improve diagnosis in cases of atypical, variant, or metastatic DFSP.	17950782	PubMed		Patel et al., 2008		4	accepted	9787	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9787	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2841	false

The study analyzed 101 patients who had undergone surgical resection of confirmed primary extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis. Specimens were reviewed for the presence of T41A, S45F, and 45P mutations on the CTNNB1 gene. Mutations were found in 76 patients, with T41A being most common (n = 49), followed by S45F (n = 18), and 45P (n = 3). The 5-year cumulative risk of recurrence was 22.8%. Further analysis revealed that patients with an S45F mutation had a 5-year recurrence risk of 63.8% and an 8.5-fold higher risk of recurrence compared to patients with wild type tumors (P=0.006).	25341748	PubMed		van Broekhoven et al., 2015		4	accepted	9788	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9788	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1260	false

ASPSCR1::TFE3 Fusion	3490	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	4239	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is characterized by the presence of an unbalanced translocation der(17)t(X;17)(p11;q25). In this 2001 paper, FISH with YAC and cosmid probes was used to localize the breakpoint to a 160 kb region with additional analyses (including Southern blotting, RACE PCR, and RT-PCR) identifying a fusion between ASPSCR1 (referred to as ASPL in this paper) and the TFE3 transcription factor. RT-PCR performed on 12 ASPS patient samples showed the presence of a fusion transcript containing 5' sequences of the novel gene ASPSCR1 fused with a 3' sequences of TFE3 in all cases. Of note, the reciprocal fusion was not detected in 11 of 12 cases consistent with cytogenetic analysis. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion was absent in control cell lines (K562 leukemia cell line). Like other TFE3 gene fusions reported in cancer, this transcript retains the bHLH-LZ DNA motif, encoded by exons 5 to 7 of TFE3. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 is of potential clinical utility in ASPS diagnosis.	11244503	PubMed		Ladanyi et al., 2001		4	accepted	9978	Somatic	2023-12-18 21:15:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9978	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3490	false

(2006) presented 2 soft tissue Ewing-like sarcoma cases (62 years of age female who deceased 10 months after biopsy; 31 years of age male who was without recurrence 30 months after operation) with CIC–DUX4 t(4;19)(q35;q13) fusion. The authors used chromosome analysis (FISH) as well as RT-PCR to analyze the fusion. The authors also carried out multiple in vitro studies. The CIC-DUX4 region inserted in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in an increase of anchorage-independent colonies in comparison to the wild-type (indicating potential oncogenic transcription effect). The CIC-DUX4 construct transfected into HeLa cells showed 130 times higher transcriptional activities in comparison to the wild-type. The authors isolated RNA from U2OS cells with CIC-DUX4 fusion, and showed increased expression of 22 genes. Increased expression of ETV1 and ERM was seen in tumor tissue of case 1. The segment including potential ERM gene promoter region (TATA box) was transfected into HeLa and cell line from case 2 tumor tissue (ECD1). The result showed 235 times stronger promoter activity in ECD1 in comparison to the HeLa cell line. Also, the authors co-transfected the promoter region of the ETV1 gene and CIC-DUX4 into HeLa cell lines, which resulted in recognition of the region by the CIC-DUX4.	16717057	PubMed		Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006		3	accepted	10112	Somatic	2024-02-12 19:13:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10112	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3121	false

The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type."	26169997	PubMed		He et al., 2015		4	accepted	10150	Somatic	2024-03-19 20:10:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10150	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3598	false

COL1A1::PDGFB Fusion	2841	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	3507				Oncogenic	Supports	B	Oncogenicity	In this study, 57 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) were evaluated. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected in 42 (74%) out of the 57 sample after performing targeted PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The 42 samples were then evaluated for PDGFB and PDGFRB gene amplification using qPCR. SYBR green assay was also used to evaluate PDGFB gene amplification in comparison with a reference gene and a normal tissue. PDGFB mRNA expression was detected in all analyzed samples and was significantly higher in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal tissue; as amplification levels (copy number of PDGFB/ copy number of reference gene) varied from 0.6. to 8.3 (mean 2.4) in 42 tumor samples, and from 0.4 to 3.0 (mean 1.2) in 20 adjacent normal tissue samples (P = 0.0002). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of PDGFB and PDGFRB showed a significant correlation (P < 0.0001). The authors of this study conclude that these results demonstrate the generation of the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcript that functions as a ligand for PDGFRB which subsequently activates the downstream PDGFB/PDGFRB signaling pathway involved in tumorigenesis of DFSP.	17431412	PubMed		Takahira et al., 2007		3	accepted	10314	Somatic	2023-08-25 18:48:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10314	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2841	false

EWSR1::FLI1 Fusion	687	Ewing Sarcoma	3369	Pediatric onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed. RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28). Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses. 19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28 (14%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4. This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9. Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG. Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient material (4 of 9). Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.	7524604	PubMed		Zoubek et al., 1994		3	accepted	10337	Somatic	2023-12-18 21:57:45 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10337	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/687	false

KANK1::NTRK2 Fusion	3027	Anaplastic Ependymoma	5889	Juvenile onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizures revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.	34651095	PubMed		Mangum et al., 2021		4	accepted	10360	Somatic	2025-02-06 18:12:09 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10360	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3027	false
KANK1::NTRK2 Fusion	3027	Glioblastoma	3068	Late young adult onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.	34041811	PubMed		Shepherd et al., 2021		3	accepted	10361	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:06 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10361	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3027	false

FGFR3 K650N	3563						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	Five patients from four families suffering from skeletal dysplasia were found to harbor a novel heterozygous K650N variant in FGFR3. The variant cosegregated in two patients from one family (a father and his daughter), whereas it occurred sporadically in the others. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the variant construct followed by kinase activity assay that showed increased activity by ~ 4 folds compared to the wild type. The authors suggest that this variant, although showing lower activation levels than other known variants responsible for severe skeletal dysplasia forms, is responsible for the milder skeletal dysplasia form seen in those patients (mild hypochondroplasia phenotype), and they further highlight the significance of Lys650 site in the active domain loop of the receptor.	11055896	PubMed		Bellus et al., 2000		2	accepted	10377	N/A	2023-01-09 21:47:11 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10377	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3563	false

The in-frame fusion transcript contained exons 1-2 of EML4 fused to exon 14 of NTRK3 which is predicted to include the entire intact NTRK3 kinase domain. The fusion transcript was cloned through RT-PCR from the patient’s pulmonary tissue and stably transduced with lentivirus into NIH-3T3 cells. These fusion expressing cells demonstrated in vitro anchorage independent growth in a soft agar assay after 21 days. These cell lines also generated large tumors when injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice after 18 days with tumors exhibiting histology similar to congenital fibrosarcoma.

EML4::NTRK3 Fusion	4167	Cervical Sarcoma					Oncogenic	Supports	C	Oncogenicity	A 33-year-old Han Chinese woman has been associated with an NTRK fusion cervical sarcoma which was positive for Pan-TRK by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. However, FISH for NTRK1 was negative. The tumor resection was performed by hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and partial vaginal resection. No evidence of lymph node metastasis was noted. Patient underwent 6 course adjuvant chemotherapy. On a follow-up visit after two months from her last follow up a mass in the right trigeminal nerve area was detected. This was morphologically confirmed as spindle cell sarcoma. NGS and IHC on this tumor specimen confirmed EML4-NTRK3 (e2-e14) fusion and pan-TRK positive, respectively. Tumor recurrence and invasion was noted one month later with a mass protruding from the vaginal external orifice. The mass was resected, and this specimen was positive for Pan-TRK by IHC. The patient passed away (14 months after diagnosis) before being enrolled in the TRK inhibitor clinical trial. The authors of this paper reported this as a first cervical sarcoma case with TRK fusion from a Chinese institution.	35572973	PubMed		Dang et al., 2022		1	accepted	10483	Somatic	2023-09-11 16:43:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10483	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4167	true

FGFR3 K650E	1308						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	A construct of PDGF and FGFR3 was created as a chimeric receptor to study the effect of the K650E variant on downstream signaling pathways. Transfecting PC12 cells showed continuous ligand-independent activity of the chimeric mutant receptor with the presence of an inducer alone (zinc) but not the ligand; PDFG. Upon addition of PDGF, further activation was also observed. Conversely, control cells showed activity only with the addition of both ligand and zinc. Gene expression profiling showed P21 gene was expressed at a higher level (1.7 folds) in mutant receptor cells, providing evidence of ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 activation. The mutant receptor produced a highly sustained ERK1/2 activation even after 1 hour of PDGF treatment, whereas wild-type expressing cells showed a decrease in ERK1/2 activity. Lastly, cells only expressing the variant K650E receptor were able to phosphorylate tyrosine in STAT1, and tyrosine, along with serine, in a ligand-independent manner in STAT3. Authors confirm that mutant FGFR3 activates ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 in a ligand-independent manner and maintains this activation over longer periods of time when treated with ligand than does the wild-type receptor.	15843401	PubMed		Nowroozi et al., 2005		3	accepted	10493	N/A	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10493	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1308	false

FGFR3 A391E	3891						Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	FRET was used to compare the structural changes in FGFR dimers when FGF1 and FGF2 bind, and found that FGF2 bound dimers were much closer to each other than FGF1. The authors also looked at FGFR3 phosphorylation using western blot analysis and found that FGF2-bound dimers had increased FGFR3 phosphorylation. Therefore it was concluded that the FGF1 bound dimer is the inactive state, while the FGF2 bound dimer is the active state. Common bladder cancer and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans variant FGFR3 A391E dimerization and phosphorylation were measured via FRET and western blot assays respectively. The A391E substitution was shown to activate FGFR3 through ligand-independent dimerization similar to the FGF2 bound state. Thus the authors concluded that the A391E mutation traps FGF3R in its most active state.	26725515	PubMed		Sarabipour et al., 2016		4	accepted	10513	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10513	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3891	false

BCOR ITD	4547	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	0081315				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The authors generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of ‘primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs)’, which are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Four novel methylation profiles were identified. One of those profiles was exhibited by 10/323 (3 %) cases, and all these tumors were found to have a duplicated region in exon 15 of BCOR [BCOR internal tandem duplication (ITD)] by DNA/RNA sequencing, identical to that of the BCOR ITD in other tumor types including clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in infants, and primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumour of infancy. The authors compared DNA methylation pattern of the BCOR-ITD positive cases with an in-house collection of > 10,000 methylation profiles from a broad variety of pediatric and adult CNS tumors. Additional tumors with variety of histologies showed the same methylation profile as BCOR-ITD positive cases, and were also found to have BCOR-ITD. The authors proposed that BCOR-ITD defines a specific molecular subtype of CNS tumors.	26919435	PubMed		Sturm et al., 2016		4	accepted	10800	Somatic	2023-11-21 08:03:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10800	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false
BCOR ITD	4547	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Infantile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	BCOR internal tandem duplications (ITDs) were found frequently in cases of clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK), a rare pediatric renal cancer. The study initially evaluated 3 CCSK samples by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing. All 3 samples demonstrated BCOR ITD by RNA sequencing. This was further validated by targeted DNA sequencing of a validation institutional cohort of 11 primary and 2 matched metastatic CCSK cases, and an additional external cohort of 13 CCSK samples. Overall, BCOR ITDs were found in 85% (23/27 cases). No BCOR ITDs were found in neither matched normal kidney/blood, nor other childhood renal cancers. Upregulation of mutant BCOR transcripts and protein expression by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was shown.	26573325	PubMed		Roy et al., 2015		5	accepted	10801	Somatic	2024-03-24 13:32:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10801	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false

BCOR encodes a key constituent of a variant polycomb repressive complex (PRC). Similar to BCOR::CCNB3-related tumors, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of PRC2-associated target genes including those associated with H3 K28 trimethylation. Disruption of polycomb repressive complex signaling likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCSK.	26573325	PubMed		Roy et al., 2015		4	accepted	10802	Somatic	2024-03-24 13:32:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10802	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false
BCOR ITD	4547	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	0081315				Oncogenic	Supports	B	Oncogenicity	10/323 studied high-grade primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-HGPNETs) clustered together based on their unique methylation profile. 10/10 of those tumors exhibited in-frame internal tandem duplications in the BCOR gene. The duplicated region was identical with that of the BCOR ITDs described in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. 1 additional tumor harbored a BCOR intragenic in-frame deletion, and two additional tumors had BCOR frameshift mutations. Gene expression of BCOR was higher in CNS HG PNET BCOR-ITD positive tumors than in other CNS tumor types, suggesting different mechanism from BCOR loss-of-function mutations reported in other malignancies,. The results are consistent with BCOR-ITDs acting as primary oncogenic drivers in a unique type of CNS HG PNETs.	26919435	PubMed		Sturm et al., 2016		4	accepted	10804	Somatic	2023-11-21 08:07:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10804	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false

IDH1 R132	58	Cholangiocarcinoma	4947		Ivosidenib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	The multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 study included patients with IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma who had progressed on previous therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to Ivosidenib or placebo. Placebo to Ivosidenib crossover was permitted on radiological progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by independent central review. Progression-free survival was significantly improved with Ivosidenib compared with the placebo (median 2.7, vs 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.37; 95% CI 0.25-0.54; one-side p<0.0001). Median overall survival was 10.8 months for the Ivosidenib group versus 9.7 months for the placebo group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.44-1.10]; p=0.060) in which 35 patients were crossover from the placebo group. In a prespecified exploratory analysis, the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method was used to reconstruct the survival curve for patients receiving a placebo as if crossover had never occurred. RPSFT assumes that the treatment effect is the same for all patients, regardless of when the treatment is given. The RPSFT-adjusted median overall survival was 6.0 months for the placebo group (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.28-0.75]; p=0.0008).	32416072	PubMed		Abou-Alfa et al., 2020	NCT02989857	5	accepted	10886	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:26 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10886	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/58	false
BCOR ITD	4547	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	0081315	Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	10 cases of high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 ITD were studied. In addition, 25 previously reported and published patients were included in survival analyses. These tumors are newly proposed to belong to a separate entity with a distinct methylation profile and a characteristic genetic alteration. The authors further describe their clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and genetic features. Shared histologic characteristics included predominantly solid growth, glioma‐like fibrillarity, perivascular pseudorosettes, and palisading necrosis, but absence of microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry testing showed absent GFAP expression, no synaptophysin expression, variable OLIG2 and NeuN positivity, and diffuse strong BCOR nuclear positivity. In 6 of 10 cases, BCOR ex15 ITD was the only pathogenic alteration seen, while other cases showed additional genetic abnormalities including CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TERT amplification or promoter hotspot mutation, and damaging mutations in TP53, BCORL1, EP300, SMARCA2 and STAG2. The authors conclude that their findings further support inclusion of HG NET with BCOR ex15 ITD as a distinct CNS tumor entity.	31104347	PubMed		Ferris et al., 2020		3	accepted	10887	Somatic	2023-11-29 14:35:20 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10887	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false

The authors have also noted that osimertinib fared better in improving his CNS symptoms compared to his earlier chemotherapy treatment.	35245845	PubMed		Copia Sperandio et al., 2022		3	accepted	11021	Somatic	2023-03-08 18:01:22 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11021	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2079	false
KIF5B::EGFR Fusion	4169	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910		Afatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Case report of a 50-year-old male with Stage 1 Lung adenocarcinoma. NGS detected the presence of KIF5B::EGFR fusion (exon 15 and exon 18). The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy but experienced disease progression to lymph nodes and left rib after 13 months. The lymph nodes showed both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. He was then treated with afatinib and showed progression-free survival for 11 months, after which intracranial metastasis was observed, and treatment with afatinib was discontinued. Following a whole brain radiation therapy, the patient was treated with Osimertinib for 4 months due to the detection of a known resistance marker T790M, however only a limited benefit was seen and the treatment was discontinued. The authors conclude the detection of the novel KIF5B-EGFR fusion in advanced NSCLC was a good indicator of response to afatinib.	34163176	PubMed		Wang et al., 2021		3	accepted	11026	Somatic	2023-07-07 17:08:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11026	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4169	false

MYB::QKI Fusion	4217	Angiocentric Glioma	0081261	Juvenile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	A comprehensive genomic analysis was conducted on 172 cases of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) across various histologic subtypes, utilizing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and/or RNA sequencing. The study identified recurrent somatic alterations in 154 tumors (90%), encompassing all 140 tumors subjected to WGS. Among the seven angiocentric gliomas (AGs) examined, six displayed intrachromosomal deletions leading to MYB::QKI rearrangements, and the remaining one contained a MYB::ESR1 rearrangement. To validate these findings, 12 additional AGs with only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n=9) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) (n=3). All tested cases were confirmed to harbor MYB rearrangement or deletion, though the specific gene partners were not determined. Functional studies both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that MYB::QKI rearrangements facilitate tumorigenesis through activating MYB through truncation of a 3' region, driving aberrant MYB::QKI expression through enhancer translocation, and losing a single copy of the QKI tumor suppressor gene. The research concluded that MYB::QKI represents a novel recurrent fusion defining AGs diagnostically.	26829751	PubMed		Bandopadhayay et al., 2016		4	accepted	11065	Somatic	2024-03-25 16:05:40 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11065	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4217	false

Of the 553 enrolled, 203 had germline BRCA1/2 mutations and 350 had non-germline BRCA1/2 mutations (including both somatic mutant and wildtype BRCA1/2); BRCA1/2 mutation status was determined via BRACAnalysis testing (Myriad Genetics). The patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive niraparib 300 mg or placebo once daily. Patients in the niraparib group had a significantly longer median duration of progression-free survival than the placebo group: 21.0 vs. 5.5 months in the gBRCA cohort (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.41; p < 0.001) and 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months in the overall non-gBRCA cohort (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.34 - 0.61; p < 0.001).	27717299	PubMed		Mirza et al., 2016	NCT01847274	4	accepted	11243	Combined	2023-05-11 23:04:07 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11243	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4409	false
ERBB2 Amplification	302	Breast Cancer	1612		Margetuximab		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase III, randomized, open-label trial, 536 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, with at least one being for metastatic disease. The patients were randomized 1:1 to margetuximab 15 mg/kg or trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (loading dose of 8 mg/kg), each in 3-week cycles. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The study found that margetuximab improved primary PFS over trastuzumab (HR, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.98; p = .03; median, 5.8 [95% CI: 5.5 - 7.0] months versus 4.9 [95% CI: 4.2 - 5.6] months). At the second interim analysis of 270 deaths, the median OS was 21.6 months for margetuximab versus 19.8 months with trastuzumab (HR, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.69 - 1.13; p = .33, and PFS showed relative risk reduction favouring margetuximab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.86; p < .001; median, 5.7 versus 4.4 months). Margetuximab improved ORR over trastuzumab at both times of analysis on October 10th, 2018, and September 10th, 2019: 22% vs 16% (p = .06;) and 25% vs 14% (p < .001) respectively.	33480963	PubMed		Rugo et al., 2021	NCT02492711	5	accepted	11249	Somatic	2024-02-14 20:51:42 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11249	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false

Patients (pts) may present with chronic-phase (CP) myeloid disease or blast-phase (BP) disease (myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed lineage) in the bone marrow (BM), and/or BP disease in extramedullary (EMD) sites. For diagnosis, the patients must have an 8p11 translocation resulting in FGFR1 rearrangement. The starting dose of pemigatinib was 13.5 mg daily (2 weeks on; 1 week off). With amendments, patients without prior therapy were eligible for a starting dose of 13.5 mg daily on a continuous schedule. The endpoints examined in this analysis include rates of complete response (CR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Among 40 patients with FGFR1-mutant MLN, the most common FGFR1 fusion partner gene was ZMYM2 (13q12) (n = 17). For previously treated patients, among the 33 patients with BM and/or EMD involvement, the CR rate was 75.8%. Among the 35 patients evaluable for cytogenetic response, the CCyR rate was 71.4%. For the 5 treatment-naive patients, 2 of 2 patients with CP disease achieved CR and CCyR, and 1 of 3 pts with BP disease achieved CR and CCyR.	10.1182/blood-2022-163099	ASH		Verstovsek et al., 2022		3	accepted	11324	Somatic	2024-12-10 19:02:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11324	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4482	false
ETV6::NTRK3 Fusion	779	Breast Secretory Carcinoma	4922				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In developing a FISH assay to detect ETV6::NTRK3 fusions, the authors found 3 of 4 secretary breast carcinomas were positive for the fusion. In a subsequent analysis of an invasive breast carcinoma tissue microarray, only 1 of 202 samples showed evidence of a fusion and this tumor was found to have histology consistent with a secretory carcinoma. None of the fusion-negative samples had secretory carcinoma histology. This suggests the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion is specific for secretory type of invasive breast carcinomas.	15101049	PubMed		Makretsov et al., 2004		3	accepted	11343	Somatic	2023-07-23 23:17:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11343	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

ZFTA::RELA Fusion	4548	Supratentorial Ependymoma, ZFTA Fusion–positive	0081252	Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In 16 of 21 supratentorial ependymomas, oncogenic fusions between ZFTA (C11orf95) and RELA were identified by a variety of methods including WGS, RT-PCR, FISH, and RNAseq. ZFTA::RELA fusions were associated with chromothripsis involving 11q13.1 that brought the 2 genes, which are normally separated by 1.9 Mb, adjacent to each other. No ZFTA::RELA fusions or 11q13.1 chromothripsis were detected in any posterior fossa tumors analyzed. The authors note this is the most common genomic alteration in supratentorial ependymoma occuring in 70% of cases and more prevalent in older children (mean age 8.3 years old).	24553141	PubMed		Parker et al., 2014		3	accepted	11432	Somatic	2023-07-12 20:55:04 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11432	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4548	false

ZFTA::RELA Fusion	4548	Supratentorial Ependymoma, ZFTA Fusion–positive	0081252	Pediatric onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Pajtler et al. generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles for 500 ependymal tumors using the Illumina 450k methylation array. Tumors were classified into nine molecular subgroups of which 88 supratentorial ependymomas (SP-EPN) had a similar methylation profile with the majority of these (88%) containing one of the two most common fusions between C11orf95 (now known as ZFTA) and RELA (type 1 or 2). The negative cases were suspected to contain the less common ZFTA::RELA fusion types 3-7, which were not assayed. This molecular subgroup with a distinctive methylation profile and a high percentage positive for ZFTA::RELA was designated as ST-EPN-RELA. No ZFTA::RELA fusions were identified in the other 8 subgroups strongly suggesting it is the primary driver of this subtype. Median age at presentation is 8 years old with a range of 0-69 years.	25965575	PubMed		Pajtler et al., 2015		3	accepted	11440	Somatic	2023-07-23 23:01:56 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11440	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4548	false
ZFTA::RELA Fusion	4548	Supratentorial Ependymoma, ZFTA Fusion–positive	0081252				Oncogenic	Supports	D	Oncogenicity	Fusions between ZFTA (C11orf95) and RELA are identified in 70% of supratentorial ependymomas. RELA is the principal effector of NF-KB signaling. The introduction of the fusion into neural stem cells (NSC) resulted in preferential accumulation of the fusion protein in the nucleus in the absence of TNF stimulation and activation of NF-KB target genes. Introduction of these ZFTA::RELA fusion containing NSC into cerebrum of mice resulted in aggressive tumors with a histology that recapitulated human supratentorial ependymoma, whereas introduction of ZFTA or RELA alone resulted in no or very few tumors.	24553141	PubMed		Parker et al., 2014		4	accepted	11441	N/A	2023-07-23 23:10:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11441	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4548	false

ESR1 Mutation	3778	Breast Cancer	1612	Adult onset	Elacestrant		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase 3 trial (NCT03778931), the selective ER-degrader elacestrant was shown to increase progression free survival (PFS) in both ESR1 mutant and ESR1 wild type, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients, previously treated with endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Of 477 patients, 239 received elacestrant and 238 received SOC (fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitors) with almost half of all patients (228 of 477) having ESR1 mutations. Elacestrant significantly reduced the risk of progression or death compared with SOC by 30% in the overall cohort and by 45% in patients with ESR1 mutation. This led to the FDA-approval of elacestrant in 2023.	35584336	PubMed		Bidard et al., 2022	NCT03778931	4	accepted	11443	Somatic	2024-04-24 15:36:03 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11443	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3778	false

The study found a 5-year and 10-year PFS of 65% and 63%, with a 5-year and 10-year OS of 87% and 37% respectively. This was is in contrast to a seminal publication in ependymoma prognosis (PMID: 25965575, EID8628), which suggested that supratentorial ependymoma, RELA fusion-positive, (now classified as 'supratentorial ependyoma, ZFTA fusion-positive'), had a poorer prognosis as compared with other ependymoma subtypes. The current study findings were comparable to more recent studies showing similar improved survival outcomes in this ependymoma subtype. Additionally, the study demonstrated a trend towards improved PFS with gross total resection vs subtotal resection (68.1% vs. 53% (P = .06)), with no surival benefit conferred by chemotherapy.	37287693	PubMed		Ng et al., 2023		3	accepted	11445	Somatic	2024-10-08 18:55:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11445	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5284	false

The current prospective study found no statistically significant difference in outcome by molecular subgroup. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the study, including small sample size and limited duration of follow-up.

EML4::NTRK3 Fusion	4167	Congenital Fibrosarcoma	8418	Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	This case study detailed a 9-month-old male with congenital fibrosarcoma with subsequent metastasis to the lungs. The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.	27148571	PubMed		Tannenbaum-Dvir et al., 2015		3	accepted	11517	Somatic	2023-11-20 11:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11517	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4167	false
PAX5 P80R	2566	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With PAX5 P80R					Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.	30510083	PubMed		Passet et al., 2019		4	accepted	11519	Somatic	2023-11-07 08:30:48 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11519	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2566	true

The child was diagnosed with Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM), which usually occurs spontaneously as solitary neoplasms in otherwise healthy patients, and rarely spreads beyond the lymph node basin. Comparative genomic hybridization array showed gains and losses at 15q and losses at 17q. The authors note that melanoma often shows three or more segmental amplifications or deletions in reproducible loci, but the alterations in this patient were not commonly seen. A breakpoint was seen in the amplified regions involving the NTRK3 gene with an amplification of 5' end and loss of 3' end and this indicated a possible fusion. Next generation sequencing confirmed the presence of NTRK3 amplification at the 5' end and loss at the 3' end. In addition, an in-frame fusion with NTRK3 at the 5' end was found involving NTRK3 exons 1 to 7 and SCAPER exons 13 to 31 as the 3' partner. This fusion did not include NTRK3 kinase domain (exons 13-18). The tumor was excised with narrow margins and follow up showed no evidence for underlying Carney complex.	31437301	PubMed		Friedman et al., 2020		1	accepted	11526	Somatic	2023-12-05 21:30:50 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11526	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4120	true
FOXR2 Rearrangement	4620	CNS Neuroblastoma With FOXR2 Activation	0080906	Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) has identified four novel methylation profiles. One of those profiles included CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2) which was seen in 14% (44/323) of the tumors. Genome-wide sequencing detected gene rearrangements involving the full-length coding sequence of FOXR2 with fusion partners JMJD1C, LOC550643, JPX, MAGEH1, or MAGED2 that resulted in high expression of FOXR2. The authors proposed that CNS NB-FOXR2 defines a specific molecular subtype of CNS neuroblastoma tumors.	26919435	PubMed		Sturm et al., 2016		4	accepted	11527	Somatic	2023-10-18 16:02:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11527	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4620	false
FOXR2 Rearrangement	4620	CNS Neuroblastoma With FOXR2 Activation	0080906	Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	DNA methylation profiling of 84 CNS-PNET tumors identified four molecular groups of CNS-PNET. One of the molecular group was CNS neuroblastoma with forkhead box R2 (FOXR2) activation (CNS_NBL) which was presented in 20 cases (24%). RNA sequencing of 14 CNS_NBL tumors detected gene fusion transcripts involving the FOXR2 gene and fusion partners, FOXR2 (Xp11.21; intergenic duplication involving FOXR2 coding sequence [CDS]), LINC00486 (2p22), TM7SF3 (12p11.23), and FRMD4A (10p11.3). All 14 CNS_NBL tumors showed high level of FOXR2 gene expression.	33536079	PubMed		Korshunov et al., 2021		4	accepted	11528	Somatic	2023-10-19 15:19:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11528	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4620	false
ASPSCR1::TFE3 Fusion	3490	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	4239	Adult onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2012 paper, the authors assessed potential characteristic markers in 24 alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS cases), age range from 13 to 61 years, and 23 non-ASPS tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for the TFE3 protein was observed in 22 of 24 ASPS specimens. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all 24 cases and was not detected in any of the 23 non-ASPS tumors. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 involves either exon 3 or 4 of TFE3 fused to ASPSCR1, which replaces the N-terminus of TFE3 but retains the DNA-binding region, activation domain, and nuclear localization signal. The fusion transcripts were composed of 7 type 1 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 4) and 17 type 2 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 3) transcripts. The authors conclude that ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion detection is an effective diagnostic technique for ASPS.	21835426	PubMed		Tsuji et al., 2012		4	accepted	11530	Somatic	2023-11-07 08:15:23 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11530	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3490	false
ASPSCR1::TFE3 Fusion	3490	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	4239	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study by Ju, et al. (2018) consisted of nine cases of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). The age of patients ranged from 7 to 36 years. Total mRNA was extracted from seven of the nine ASPS paraffin specimens successfully. RT-PCR detected the fusion ASPSCR1::TFE3 type 1 (ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4) in 3 cases and ASPSCR1::TFE3 type 2 (ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3) in the other 4 cases. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper. The authors conclude that detection of this fusion may aid in diagnosis in atypical cases.	28766250	PubMed		Ju et al., 2018		3	accepted	11531	Somatic	2023-11-07 08:16:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11531	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3490	false
ASPSCR1::TFE3 Fusion	3490	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Childhood onset,Juvenile onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Argani, et al. (2001) included eight morphologically distinctive renal cell carcinomas with the t(X;17) translocation as seen in alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), with the distinction that the t(X;17) translocation is cytogenetically balanced in these renal tumors. The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3. These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.	11438465	PubMed		Argani et al., 2001		3	accepted	11532	Somatic	2024-02-13 19:34:56 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11532	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3490	false
v::TFE3 Fusion	3598	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Young adult onset,Juvenile onset,Early young adult onset,Childhood onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Argani. et al,. (2016) included a total of 60 cases with known TFE3 gene rearrangements in this study of Xp11 translocation positive neoplasms (47 RCC, 8 PEComa, and 5 melanotic renal cancers). The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined. The authors conclude that despite an identical gene fusion, the RCCs are distinct from the corresponding mesenchymal neoplasms and that the data can expand further the clinicopathologic features of cancers with specific TFE3 gene fusions.	26975036	PubMed		Argani et al., 2016		4	accepted	11533	Somatic	2024-02-13 19:22:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11533	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3598	false
v::TFEB Fusion	4747	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset,Early young adult onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions. Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.	34986355	PubMed		Bakouny et al., 2022		4	accepted	11534	Somatic	2024-02-13 19:34:14 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11534	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4747	false
v::TFEB Fusion	4747	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Early young adult onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and are characterized by a specific chromosome translocation involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years. All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases. The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.	22895266	PubMed		Rao et al., 2012		3	accepted	11535	Somatic	2024-02-20 21:41:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11535	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4747	false
YAP1::TFE3 Fusion	4622	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	0080190	Young adult onset,Juvenile onset,Middle age onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study by Antonescu, et al. (2013) included 10 cases with a diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), which showed unusual morphologic features such as abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, mature vascular channel formation and were negative for WWTR1 and CAMTA1 rearrangements by FISH. Patients ranged in age from 14 to 50 years. RNA sequencing identified a YAP1::TFE3 fusion transcript, and RT-PCR confirmed the fusion transcript of YAP1 exon 1 to exon 4 of TFE3. All 10 cases investigated by FISH showed TFE3 break-apart signal, and 8 of the 10 also showed YAP1 rearrangement. A control group of similar tumor types which included 18 epithelioid hemangiomas, 9 pseudomyogenic HE, and 3 epithelioid angiosarcomas showed no TFE3 rearrangements suggesting the YAP1::TFE3 is specific for this subgroup of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.	23737213	PubMed		Antonescu et al., 2013		3	accepted	11536	Somatic	2023-12-19 16:41:52 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11536	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4622	false

Eleven of the 29 tumors had a targeted sequencing panel which identified the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in 9 (81%) patients and the YAP1::TFE3 fusion in 2 (19%) patients. The authors state that no single specific morphological feature was defining EHE but a constellation of features and the molecular studies could provide assurance of the diagnosis.	37810439	PubMed		Lahori et al., 2023		2	accepted	11537	Somatic	2023-12-19 16:42:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11537	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4622	false
YAP1::TFE3 Fusion	4622	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	0080190	Adult onset			Oncogenic	Supports	B	Oncogenicity	This 2021 paper by Dermawan, et al. included 24 cases of YAP1::TFE3 fusion-positive epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), with an age range of 20 to 78 years old. All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ. Thus the a YAP-like transcriptional program in YAP1::TFE3 fused EHE, is considered analogous to WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE (PMID: 33913810).	34381186	PubMed		Dermawan et al., 2021		2	accepted	11538	Somatic	2024-02-15 22:28:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11538	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4622	false
v::TFEB Fusion	4747	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Juvenile onset,Early young adult onset,Childhood onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.	15644781	PubMed		Argani et al., 2005		2	accepted	11539	Somatic	2024-02-15 12:29:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11539	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4747	false

Of the 20 patients treated with Larotrectinib, one patient (patient 7) contained an adenocarcinoma with a SQSTM1::NTRK1 fusion identified with the Archer FusionPlex targeted RNA NGS assay. Patient had no CNS metastases prior to treatment. After treatment with Larotrectinib, a 60% decrease in the SQSTM1::NTRK1 patient lesion size with no CNS metastases was observed. Patient received larotrectinib treatment for 14.6 months with a partial response, after which the patient decided to discontinue therapy for reasons other than progression.	35085007	PubMed		Drilon et al., 2022	NCT02576431,NCT02122913	3	accepted	11574	Somatic	2024-04-15 14:29:18 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11574	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/778	false

Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.	32519338	PubMed		Panse et al., 2021		3	accepted	11576	Somatic	2024-02-05 20:34:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11576	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1252	false

The authors analyzed their clinical, pathologic and molecular characteristic and compared them with Clear Cell Sarcoma of Kidney (CCSK) and soft tissue sarcoma with the same genetic abnormality (BCOR ex15 ITD). Cases of CNS HGNET with BCOR ex15 ITD were histologically characterized by glial cell morphology, ependymoma-like perivascular pseudorosettes and palisading necrosis. Immunohistochemically, they showed diffuse staining of Olig2, and focal staining of GFAP, S-100 protein and synaptophysin. Clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically CNS HG NETs with BCOR ex15 ITD were distinct from CCSK and soft tissue sarcomas with BCOR ex15 ITD, supporting that these should be considered a unique type of CNS tumor.	29226988	PubMed		Yoshida et al., 2018		3	accepted	11581	Somatic	2023-11-29 14:38:17 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11581	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false

Patients with VGLL2 or NCOA2 fusion-positive RMS were alive and well on follow-up (median of 7 years) and none developed distant metastases. 7 of 9 patients with MYOD1 mutant RMS died of the disease with a median of 1.5 years. 3 fusion/MYOD1 negative cases with available follow up show no evidence of disease. This supports a better prognosis for spindle cell / sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma with VGLL1 or NCOA2 fusions and a worse prognosis for patients with MYOD1 p.L122R mutation.	26501226	PubMed		Alaggio et al., 2016		4	accepted	11587	Somatic	2023-11-28 21:01:19 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11587	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2901	false
MYOD1 L122R	2901	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this study, FISH, targeted DNA, and whole transcriptome sequencing were used to define a better molecular classification of sclerosing and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. 11 of 26 were congenital/infantile type diagnosed at birth or within one year of age, 10 of which harbored recurrent fusions involving VGLL2 or NCOA2 genes. The remaining 15 cases were diagnosed in older patients (2-17 years old); 10 showed MYOD1 p.L122R mutation, 4 of which showed an additional concomitant PIK3CA mutation (p.E542V, p.E545K, p.Q546R, or p.G1049R). Cases with both PIK3CA and MYOD1 mutations were uniformly characterized by a sclerosing histology. MYOD1 mutation was homozygous in 8 cases. This supports MYOD1 p.L122R as diagnostic for spindle cell / sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma.	26501226	PubMed		Alaggio et al., 2016		4	accepted	11588	Somatic	2023-11-28 21:01:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11588	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2901	false
BCOR ITD	4547	Sarcoma	1115	Infantile onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	BCOR expression was evaluated in a cohort of 25 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) with BCOR fusions (BCOR::MAML3, BCOR::CCNB3), BCOR exon 15 ITDs, or YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion (which is known to upregulate BCOR) using anti-BCOR monoclonal antibody clone C-10 (sc-514576) as an immunohistochemical marker. A control group consisted of 20 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) with various non-BCOR genetic abnormalities, 10 fusion-negative SBRCTs, 74 synovial sarcomas, 29 rhabdomyosarcomas, and other sarcoma types. All SBRCTs with BCOR-fusions and most tumors with BCOR ITD (93%), showed strong and diffuse nuclear BCOR immunoreactivity; these tumors were also positive for SATB2 expression. Sarcomas with BCOR fusions and BCOR-ITDs share molecular features (including high BCOR expression and the presence of SATB2 expression), and BCOR immunohistochemical stain is a highly sensitive marker for SBRCTs with BCOR abnormalities.	27428733	PubMed		Kao et al., 2016		3	accepted	11589	Somatic	2024-04-14 16:43:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11589	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4547	false
CIC::DUX4 Fusion	3121	CIC-rearranged Sarcoma	0081250				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The authors recognize that differentiating between Ewing sarcoma and CIC::DUX4 fusion associated sarcoma can be challenging due to overlapping histological and immunohistochemical phenotypes. In this study, 70 patients with undifferentiated round cell sarcoma or Ewing-like sarcoma were examined by EWSR1 break apart FISH, CIC break apart FISH, and CIC::DUX4 RT-PCR. 6 cases (8.6%) of CIC::DUX4 sarcoma were identified and tended to exhibit cytologic pleomorphism with bizarre nuclei and multinucleated cells and myxoid stoma. Although there wasn't a difference in overall survival, CIC::DUX4 sarcomas showed shorter disease-free survival and poorer response to treatment than Ewing sarcomas.	35151033	PubMed		Song et al., 2022		3	accepted	11594	Somatic	2024-02-12 01:12:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11594	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3121	false
CIC::DUX4 Fusion	3121	CIC-rearranged Sarcoma	0081250	Adult onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2012 paper, 22 small blue round cell tumors that remained unclassified after screening for known sarcoma-related translocations, were analyzed for CIC and FUS rearrangements. 68% (15/22) were positive for CIC rearrangements by FISH. Further analysis (RACE, RT-PCR, and/or long-range DNA PCR) on 2 cases revealed CIC was fused to DUX4 (with duplicate copies found on 4q35 and10q26.3). FISH confirmed the fused signals of CIC with either 4q35 or 10q26.3 in 6 cases.The authors suggest this is a newly defined subgroup of primitive round cell sarcomas characterized by CIC rearrangements, distinct from Ewing sarcoma.	22072439	PubMed		Italiano et al., 2012		3	accepted	11595	Somatic	2024-02-12 01:14:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11595	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3121	false
EWSR1::ERG Fusion	4668	Ewing Sarcoma	3369	Pediatric onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	An analysis of 85 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) that were negative for EWSR1, CIC, or BCOR by FISH identified 6 FUS::ERG and 1 FUS::FEV fusions. Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining. Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement. The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.	26690869	PubMed		Chen et al., 2016		2	accepted	11603	Somatic	2024-02-12 02:26:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11603	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4668	false
LMNA::NTRK1 Fusion	1252	Lipofibromatosis-like Neural Tumor	0080894	Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.	32299759	PubMed		Malik et al., 2020		3	accepted	11650	Somatic	2024-04-15 13:35:59 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11650	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1252	false

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics.	34381186	PubMed		Dermawan et al., 2021		4	accepted	11682	Somatic	2024-01-16 20:51:56 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11682	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4622	false
v::TFE3 Fusion	3598	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	0081413	Childhood onset,Early young adult onset,Adult onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	A study of 443 renal cell carcinoma identified 7 cases with an Xp11 translocation. The median age of the 7 patients was 41 years (range, 15 to 59 years). Of the 244 cases with a successful karyotype, 4 were identified to have an Xp11 translocation. The fusion types of two cases were determined to be PSF::TFE3 and PRCC::TFE3. The other two cases were assumed to have the ASPSCR1::TFE3 gene fusion. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in one cases was confirmed by RT-PCR. Likewise, the PRCC::TFE3 fusion was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of the 199 samples, for which the karyotype was not determined 3 cases were assumed Xp11 translocation by positive immunostaining for TFE3.	19228722	PubMed		Komai et al., 2009		2	accepted	11683	Somatic	2024-02-20 18:08:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11683	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3598	false

TPM3::NTRK1 Fusion	2861	Lung Carcinoma	3905	Middle age onset	Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancers. This was achieved by reviewing data from two global, multicenter clinical trials of patients treated with larotrectinib: a phase II adult and young adult basket trial (NCT02576431) and a phase I adult trial (NCT02122913). The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively. Of the total of 20 NTRK-fusions positive lung cancer cases, 6 had TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, but detailed response information was only provided for one TPM3::NTRK1 positive case. This patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer which previously progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy after 9 months and on the PD-1 inhibitor dostarlimab after 2 months. A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control. The authors concluded that larotrectinib was highly active with rapid and durable responses, extended survival benefit, and a favorable long-term safety profile in patients with advanced lung cancer harboring NTRK gene fusions, including the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion.	35085007	PubMed		Drilon et al., 2022	NCT02576431,NCT02122913	3	accepted	11692	Somatic	2024-05-13 16:33:50 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11692	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2861	false

Invasive adenocarcinoma stage IIB (pT4aN0) of the cecum was identified in the pathology, with intact MMR. The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy. A year later the patient showed recurrence of the tumor mass consistent with stage IV recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer. Testing revealed the tumor to be MSI-High. TPR-NTRK1 was found in the tumor by NGS and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was found (39 mutations/Mb). Pembrolizumab was given (four cycles), but patient progressed. Combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab and nivolumab was then given, followed by further progression. Patient was then given NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib and after 5 weeks a considerable decrease in the size of peritoneal metastasis was seen, accompanied by other tumor shrinkage and remarkable improvement of symptoms. Curative-intent surgical resection of the tumor mass was performed, and adjuvant larotrectinib was declined. No evidence of tumor was apparent after 26 months.	35815302	PubMed		Kasi et al., 2022		4	accepted	11706	Somatic	2024-04-15 17:37:14 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11706	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3333	false

MYB::QKI Fusion	4217	Angiocentric Glioma	0081261	Childhood onset,Young adult onset,Juvenile onset,Middle age onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Comprehensive molecular studies through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, as well as mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing and FISH were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) in 2016. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and the dominant lesions were MYB fusions (21/32; 66%). A MYB::QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (13/15; 87%) with the reamining two tumors harborting a MYB::ESR1 fusion (1/15) or QKI rearrangement (1/15). The last case with QKI rearrangement had no apparent involvement of MYB or MYBL1, only showing split signals using FISH break-apart probes across QKI. However, the study did not have sufficient derivatives from this tumor for FFPE RNA-seq, so it was unable to determine whether a cryptic MYB::QKI aberration was present in this case, or whether QKI was fused to another gene partner. Most MYB::QKI fusions (78%) were between MYB exon 15 and QKI exon 5. Fusions were also identified between MYB exon 9 and QKI exon 5. These fusions removed the 3'UTR regulatory site or the entire inhibitory C-terminal domain of MYB, leading to its overexpression. Two tumors with a MYB::QKI fusion also harbored a BRAF p.V600E mutation.	26810070	PubMed		Qaddoumi et al., 2016		3	accepted	11769	Somatic	2024-03-25 16:16:11 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11769	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4217	false

MYB::QKI Fusion	4217	Angiocentric Glioma	0081261	Juvenile onset,Childhood onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The study compiled clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas. Of the 35 angiocentric gliomas, 22 had identified gene partners, primarily QKI (n=19), PCDHGA1 (n=1), LOC105378099 (n=1) and ESR1 (n=1).	31595312	PubMed		Chiang et al., 2019		4	accepted	11773	Somatic	2024-03-25 16:12:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11773	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4217	false
MYB Rearrangement	4218	Angiocentric Glioma	0081261				Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.	23633565	PubMed		Ramkissoon et al., 2013		2	accepted	11774	Somatic	2024-03-25 16:22:15 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11774	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4218	false
MYB Truncation	5040	Angiocentric Glioma	0081261	Juvenile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DAs, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AGs, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements, and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Results revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs) including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas.The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.	21046410	PubMed		Tatevossian et al., 2010		2	accepted	11775	Somatic	2024-04-16 18:45:52 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11775	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5040	false
MYB Rearrangement	4218	Isomorphic Diffuse Glioma		Childhood onset,Young adult onset,Middle age onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors	31563982	PubMed		Wefers et al., 2020		3	accepted	11776	Somatic	2024-07-14 00:00:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11776	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4218	true

IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.	31563982	PubMed		Wefers et al., 2020		4	accepted	11780	Somatic	2024-07-14 00:00:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11780	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4878	true
MYBL1 Rearrangement	4878	Diffuse Astrocytoma, MYB- Or MYBL1-altered	0081279	Juvenile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.	23633565	PubMed		Ramkissoon et al., 2013		4	accepted	11781	Somatic	2024-03-26 18:57:49 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11781	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4878	false
YWHAE::NUTM2A Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2B Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2E Fusion	5283	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Infantile onset,Juvenile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2012 study O’Meara et al. included 51 clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK). Using an index CCSK with the t(10;17)(q22;p13) identified by cytogenetics, they were able to map the breakpoints and identified the gene fusion transcript YHWAE::FAM22, currently known as YHWAE::NUTM2. Using RT-PCR they screened an additional 50 samples. Overall, fusion positive transcripts of YHWAE::NUTM2 were detected in 7/51 (14%) cases. Ages of the patients ranged from 0 to 6 years. This rearrangement produces an in-frame YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript, comprising exons 1–5 of YWHAE and exons 2–7 of NUTM2. Of the 3 cases with RNA sufficient to sequence the entire coding region, the YWHAE fusion partner was identified as either NUTM2B (FAM22B) or NUTM2E (FAM22E). None of the transcript-positive cases presented with stage I disease, suggesting the fusion may be associated with poorer outcome. Tumor cellularity was significantly higher in the cases that were transcript-positive.	22294382	PubMed		O'Meara et al., 2012		3	accepted	11782	Somatic	2024-10-04 13:59:01 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11782	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5283	false
YWHAE::NUTM2A Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2B Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2E Fusion	5283	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2020 study Kenny et al. included 68 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Using RT-PCR with RNA extracted from FFPE tumour tissue they detected a YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript in 1/68 (1.5%) of cases. The majority of cases (54/68, 79%) had a BCOR ITD which is mutually exclusive with the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion. The group generated a cell line model system in which inducible expression of YWHAE::NUTM2 could be used to identify reliable immunohistochemical markers. The study concluded that reliance on a single marker in CCSK is not ideal and suggested BCOR, TLE1 and CCND1 could be useful as a group of markers, with the YWHAE::NUTM2 case as well as BCOR-ITD cases staining strongly for all three of these markers, while 63 control samples from tumor types often considered in the differential diagnosis were negative or weakly staining.	32364435	PubMed		Kenny et al., 2020		2	accepted	11783	Somatic	2024-10-04 13:58:48 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11783	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5283	false
YWHAE::NUTM2A Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2B Fusion OR YWHAE::NUTM2E Fusion	5283	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2016 study Kenny et al. included 159 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV. The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.	27000436	PubMed		Kenny et al., 2016		2	accepted	11784	Somatic	2024-10-04 13:58:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11784	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5283	false
ARID1A Loss OR ARID1A Wildtype	4882	Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma	0050934		Dasatinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 clinical study, 28 patients with recurrent Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary, Fallopian Tube, Peritoneum, or Endometrium, harboring either wild-type ARID1A or ARID1A loss were recruited, and treated with Dasatinib. Of the 28 patients, 15 patients had retained BAF250a, while 13 had a loss of BAF250a. In this cohort, 53.6% of the patients had disease progression, 28% had stable disease, however, only one patient had a partial response. The median duration of stable disease was 5.67 months (3.55 - 20.73) in the loss of BAF250a group, and it was 4.65 months (1.58 - 17.84) in the retained BAF250a group. Overall, the study reported that Dasatinib was not effective as a single-agent treatment for recurrent Clear Cell Carcinoma.	37418832	PubMed		O'Cearbhaill et al., 2023		3	accepted	11789	Somatic	2024-03-25 20:09:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11789	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4882	false
MYB Rearrangement	4218	Diffuse Astrocytoma, MYB- Or MYBL1-altered	0081279	Childhood onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DA, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AG, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.	21046410	PubMed		Tatevossian et al., 2010		2	accepted	11790	Somatic	2024-04-16 16:05:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11790	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4218	false
CBFB::MYH11 Fusion	427	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13.1q22) Or T(16;16)(p13.1;q22)	0081084	Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	A small study on 18 patients of AML with inv(16)(p13q22) [now known to correspond to CBFB::MYH11 fusion] identified abnormal eosinophils as a unique morphologic characteristic of this entity. 76.5% achieved complete remission and 59% remained in first remission. The main conclusion was that AML with inv(16) represents a unique subtype of AML with distinct morphology, cytogenetics, and favorable prognosis.	6577285	PubMed		Le Beau et al., 1983		3	accepted	11793	Somatic	2024-04-16 15:37:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11793	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/427	false
RUNX1::RUNX1T1 Fusion	2995	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With T(8;21); (q22; Q22.1)	0081093				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.	1391946	PubMed		Erickson et al., 1992		3	accepted	11878	Somatic	2024-04-10 10:49:52 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11878	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2995	false
RUNX1::RUNX1T1 Fusion	2995	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With T(8;21); (q22; Q22.1)	0081093	Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset,Intermediate young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.	1467524	PubMed		Hurwitz et al., 1992		3	accepted	11879	Somatic	2024-04-10 10:53:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11879	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2995	false

All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.	9746770	PubMed		Grimwade et al., 1998		4	accepted	11880	Somatic	2024-04-10 10:55:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11880	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2995	false

RUNX1::RUNX1T1 Fusion	2995	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With T(8;21); (q22; Q22.1)	0081093	Adult onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21) and 50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases. Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.	9180287	PubMed		Nakamura et al., 1997		3	accepted	11882	Somatic	2024-04-10 11:00:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11882	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2995	false
CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion	2499	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion		Infantile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2012 study they included 14 patients diagnosed with non-down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), a subtype of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Transcriptome sequencing was performed on diagnostic leukemia cells. In 7 of 14 cases a cryptic inversion on chromosome 16 [inv(16)(p13.3q24.3)] was detected that results in the joining of CBFA2T3, a member of the ETO family of nuclear corepressors, to GLIS2, a member of the GLI family of transcription factors. In 6/7 cases exon 10 of CBFA2T3 was fused to exon 3 of GLIS2, while in the remaining case exon 11 of CBFA2T3 was fused to exon 1 of GLIS2. Analysis of a validation cohort consisting of diagnostic leukemia cells from 62 AMKL cases (34 pediatric and 28 adult) revealed 6 additional pediatric samples carrying CBFA2T3::GLIS2 for an overall frequency of 27% (13/48) in pediatric AMKL. Patients found to have the CBFA2T3::GLIS2 gene fusion were aged from 0 - 4 years. Overall the presence of CBFA2T3::GLIS2 identified a subgroup of patients with a significantly worse overall survival. CBFA2T3::GLIS2 functions, in part, as a gain-of-function GLIS2 allele, with enhanced BMP2/4 signaling, however the fusion likely requires cooperating lesions for leukemogenesis.	23153540	PubMed		Gruber et al., 2012		4	accepted	11884	Somatic	2024-04-27 08:41:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11884	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2499	true
CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion	2499	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion		Infantile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2012 study the authors performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) of leukemic cells obtained after engraftment in immunodeficient mice from 5 patients with Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). A novel in-frame fusion transcript CBFA2T3::GLIS2 was detected in one sample. They then performed RT-PCR analysis on an independent validation cohort of 22 non-down syndrome (DS) pediatric AMKL, 9 DS AMKL, and 8 adult AMKL samples. They detected the CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion in 7/22 non-DS pediatric AMKL samples, but not in DS AMKL or adult AMKL samples. CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion results from a chromosomal inversion of chromosome 16 and leads to a fusion between exon 11 of CBFA2T3 and exon 3 of GLIS2. GLIS2 expression was only detected in AMKL samples with the CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion, where as CBFA2T3 was expressed in all AMKL samples. Analysis of global gene expression found the fusion was associated with a distinct molecular signature, including up-regulation of NCAM1 and of several target genes of the Hedgehog signaling pathway such as BMP2, BMP4, GATA3, and CCND2.	23045605	PubMed		Thiollier et al., 2012		4	accepted	11885	Somatic	2024-04-27 08:41:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11885	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2499	true

CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion	2499	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CBFA2T3::GLIS2 Fusion		Early young adult onset,Childhood onset,Juvenile onset,Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This 2013 study included 7 pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients defined as cytogenetically normal (CN). They performed whole-transcriptome massively parallel sequencing and identified a chimeric transcript involving CBFA2T3 and GLIS2, resulting from a cryptic inversion of the telomeric region of chromosome 16 in 3/7 patients. Two patients showed the fusion between exon 11 of CBFA2T3 and exon 3 of GLIS2, while the third showed CBFA2T3 exon 10 fused to exon 2 of GLIS2. Using RT-PCR the authors then examined a validation cohort of 230 children with newly diagnosed de novo CN-AML and identified CBFA2T3::GLIS2 in a further 19 cases with CBFA2T3 exon 11 fused to GLIS2 exon 3. CN-AML patients harboring the CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion gene were aged from 0 - 17 years. These results indicate that the CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusion transcript is not just seen in non-down syndrome AMKL and should be more broadly considered as a genetic abnormality that is shared with pediatric CN-AML where it is also associated with significantly worse event free survival.	23407549	PubMed		Masetti et al., 2013		4	accepted	11887	Somatic	2024-04-27 08:41:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11887	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2499	true
YAP1::MAMLD1 Fusion	4952	Supratentorial Ependymoma, YAP1 Fusion–positive	0081253	Congenital onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	A total of 15 pediatric patients with supratentorial ependymomas harboring YAP1::MAMLD1 fusions were reported. In all 15 cases, YAP1::MAMLD1 fusions were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. In the majority of cases (14 of 15), the fusion joined exon 5 of YAP1 with exon 3 of MAMLD1. In 1 case, the fusion occurred between YAP1 exon 5 and MAMLD1 exon 2. Patients tended to be female (13 of 15) and less than 3 years old at diagnosis (12 of 15). All cases exhibited similar histopathological features including moderate to high cellularity with small to medium-sized nuclei, perivascular pseudo-rosettes, and strikingly dot-like epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positivity. The authors suggest the characteristic histopathological, cytogenetic, and molecular features of this tumor type occurring mostly in young girls less than 3 years of age should be considered a distinct disease entity.	30246434	PubMed		Andreiuolo et al., 2019		4	accepted	11888	Somatic	2024-08-12 17:03:22 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11888	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4952	false

YAP1::v Fusion	4954	Supratentorial Ependymoma, YAP1 Fusion–positive	0081253				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	DNA methylation profiling of 500 ependymal tumors identified 9 molecular profiles with 3 occurring in the supratentorial compartment (designated ST EPN). RNA sequencing performed in 7 of the 13 cases that clustered with one of the non-RELA subgroups of supratentorial ependymoma (and had sufficient high-quality RNA) identified YAP1::MAMLD1 fusions in 6 of 7 tumors and a YAP1::FAM118B fusion in the remaining tumor. The YAP1::MAMLD1 fusions consisted of YAP1 exons 1–5 or 1–6 fused in-frame to MAMLD1 exons 2–7 or 3–7. In the YAP1::FAM118B fusion, YAP1 exons 1–7 is fused in-frame to FAM118B exons 3–9. No YAP1 fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in any of the 48 additional ependymal tumors of the other molecular subgroups of the posterior fossa or supratentorial regions. The authors conclude that this demonstrates YAP1 fusion-positive cases characterize another molecular subgroup of ST EPNs distinct from RELA fusion-positive ST EPNs.	25965575	PubMed		Pajtler et al., 2015		4	accepted	11890	Somatic	2024-08-12 17:04:57 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11890	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4954	false
BCOR::CCNB3 Fusion	3120	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2018 study, the authors aimed to identify driver events in 'double negative' clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) where neither BCOR ITDs nor the YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion are detected. Eleven CCSK cases were included in the study, from pediatric patients aged 2 - 8 years. Using RT-PCR, BCOR exon 15 ITDs were detected in 10/11 cases, with only 1 case, an 8-year-old male, found to be a double negative. The case was identified to have a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion by a NanoString-based sarcoma fusion assay, with exon 15 of BCOR fused to exon 5 of CCNB3, confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. CCNB3 immunoreactivity was identified in the BCOR::CCNB3 case and not in the BCOR ITD CCSK cases tested. The authors conclude this is the first report of a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion detected in a CCSK of a young child, with the same fusion typically seen in primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas of male adolescents, and that other cases of double negative CCSK require characterization.	28833375	PubMed		Wong et al., 2018		2	accepted	12003	Somatic	2024-04-16 12:29:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12003	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3120	false
BCOR::CCNB3 Fusion	3120	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2020 study, the authors report two patients with BCOR::CCNB3 fusion-positive clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Cases were males aged 10 and 14 years who presented with advanced disease. With initial testing, both cases were negative for a BCOR ITD. However, RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were able to detect a BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion. The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion.	31876361	PubMed		Han et al., 2020		2	accepted	12004	Somatic	2024-04-16 12:29:14 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12004	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3120	false
BCOR::CCNB3 Fusion	3120	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	4880	Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2017 study, the authors describe two primary renal sarcomas harboring BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusions and compare the morphological and immunochemical features to typical clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). The two tumors were diagnosed in males aged 11 and 12 years and were unclassified at diagnosis with overlapping features of CCSK and renal synovial sarcoma. The BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion was detected by FISH in the two cases. Although these tumors were originally unclassified, with the molecular findings the cases were considered compatible with a CCSK diagnosis. The authors conclude there may be a “BCOR-alteration family” of renal and extra-renal neoplasms with overlapping clinicopathologic features.	28817404	PubMed		Argani et al., 2017		2	accepted	12005	Somatic	2024-04-16 12:28:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12005	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3120	false
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	NUT Midline Carcinoma	0060463				Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	"RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors. Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC. Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement. The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as ""NUT-associated tumors"", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma."	29356724	PubMed		Dickson et al., 2018		2	accepted	12009	Somatic	2024-06-14 06:31:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12009	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	false
v::ALK Fusion	495	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Alectinib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this global phase 3 trial, 257 patients with ALK-positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer were treated with either alectinib (n = 130) or chemotherapy (n = 127). 93.8 % of the patients who had received alectinib versus 63% who were in the chemotherapy group were alive and disease-free at 2 years. A hazard ratio of 0.24 (95% CI; 0.13 - 0.43, p < 0.001) was reported for disease recurrence or death, which implies a 76% lower risk with adjuvant alectinib than chemotherapy. 98.4% of the patients in the alectinib group, and 93.3% of the patients in the chemotherapy group reported at least one adverse event. Serious adverse events were reported in 13.3% of the patients in the alectinib group compared to 8.3% of the patients in the chemotherapy group. Overall, the study found improved disease-free survival in the alectinib group compared to the chemotherapy group.	38598794	PubMed		Wu et al., 2024	NCT03456076	5	accepted	12012	Somatic	2024-04-25 21:09:40 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12012	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false

EGFR Exon 20 Insertion	707	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Chemotherapy,Amivantamab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 3 trial, 308 patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR exon 20 insertions were treated with a combination of amivantamab and chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) [n = 153] or chemotherapy alone [n = 155]. The median PFS in the aminvantamab-chemotherapy group was 11.4 months which was significantly higher than the chemotherapy group (median PFS of 6.7 months). The hazard ratio reported for disease progression was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.30 - 0.53, p <0.001), while the hazard ratio reported for death for amivantamab-chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy was 0.67 (95% CI; 0.42 - 1.09, p =0.11). The median objective response in the amivantamab-chemotherapy group was 9.7 months (95% CI; 8.2-13.5) compared to 4.4 months (95% CI; 4.1-5.6) in the chemotherapy group. The majority of patients in the cohort reported at least one adverse event. Overall, the study reported significantly better clinical results in the patients treated with amivantamab-chemotherapy combination therapy compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone as a first-line treatment.	37870976	PubMed		Zhou et al., 2023	NCT04538664	4	accepted	12014	Somatic	2024-04-25 22:35:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12014	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/707	false

Significantly higher PFS was noted in the group treated with osimertinib and chemotherapy compared to osimertinib monotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.62 (95% CI; 0.49 - 0.79, p < 0.0001). After 24 months, 57% (95% CI; 50-63) and 41% (95% CI; 35-47) of the patients in the osimertinib and chemotherapy versus osimertinib monotherapy groups respectively, were alive and progression-free. An objective response was reported in 83% of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group, while an objective response was observed in 76% of the patients in the osimertinib monotherapy group.

WWTR1::CAMTA1 Fusion	723	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	0080190	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2011 study, the authors identified the genes involved in a reciprocal t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation that had been detected in epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) by karyotype. RNA isolated from an EHE with the known t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation underwent whole-transcriptome sequencing and they detected a fusion that contained exon 2 of WWTR1 fused to exon 9 of CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in another 4 cases of t(1;3)(p36;q25) positive EHE. The fusion involved either exon 2 (type 1 fusion transcript) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion transcript) of WWTR1 in-frame to exon 9 of CAMTA1. To determine the incidence of WWTR1::CAMTA1 they performed FISH with break-apart probes that flanked the WWTR1 or CAMTA1 gene regions on 47 EHE samples. The analysis detected CAMTA1 rearrangement in 39 of 45 EHE tumors (87%) and 42 of 47 (89%) harbored a rearrangement of the WWTR1 gene region, while all other vascular tumors were negative. The authors conclude that the gene fusion is exclusively present in almost all EHEs, demonstrating it to be a disease-defining genetic alteration.	21885404	PubMed		Tanas et al., 2011		4	accepted	12017	Somatic	2024-05-01 14:05:22 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12017	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/723	false
WWTR1::CAMTA1 Fusion	723	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	0080190	Juvenile onset,Adult onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2014 study, the authors included a cohort of 39 cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) from different anatomical sites to investigate gene fusions by FISH and RT-PCR. The patients' ages ranged from 9 to 85 years. For the 35 samples they were able to test successfully, 33 were positive for WWTR1::CAMTA1 (94%) and 2 were positive for YAP1::TFE3 (6%). There were 8 cases with a detected fusion gene via RT-PCR that were negative with FISH testing, and 3 cases negative with RT-PCR that had a positive FISH result. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 8 in 13 cases and exon 9 in 7 cases, and exon 3 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 9 in 3 cases. The authors conclude that identification of the fusion in EHEs can provide important diagnostic information, especially in cases with aberrant morphology or limited biopsy material.	24986479	PubMed		Flucke et al., 2014		4	accepted	12019	Somatic	2024-05-02 11:38:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12019	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/723	false

Among the 289 patients (40.8%) with alterations (including PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN alterations), the median progression-free survival was 7.3 months in the capivasertib–fulvestrant group compared to 3.1 months in the placebo–fulvestrant group with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65). In the capivasertib–fulvestrant group, 110 patients had PIK3CA mutations, 18 had AKT mutations, 21 had PTEN alterations, 2 had PI3KCA and AKT1 double mutations, and 4 had both PIK3CA and PTEN alterations. A breakdown of response by individual mutation was not provided.	37256976	PubMed		Turner et al., 2023	NCT04305496	3	accepted	12020	Somatic	2024-10-29 23:46:45 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12020	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5065	false
NF1 Mutation OR GNA11 Q209L	5071	Cancer	162		Trametinib		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 clinical trial, 50 patients were treated with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Among them, 46 had tumours harbouring NF1 mutations (S1 protocol), while 4 had non-uveal melanomas harbouring the GNA11 Q209L mutation (S2 protocol). The 6 month PFS in S1 and S2 subprotocols was 21% (90% CI; 12-34) and 50% (90% CI; 22-100) respectively. The median OS was 10.4 months in the S1 (90% CI; 7.4-13.3) and 19.2 months (90% CI; 18.1 - NA) in the S2 subprotocol. In the S1 subprotocol, 2 patients had a partial response (4.3% ORR; 90% CI; 0.8-13.1), while in the S2 subprotocol, 1 patient experienced a partial response (25% ORR; 90% CI; 1.3-75.1). These results show that inactivating NF1 or GNA11 mutations alone are not good indicators of response to trametinib in heavily pretreated patients with solid tumours. While this study did not meet its pre-specified endpoints, partial responses were noted in some of the patients treated with trametinib.	37053535	PubMed		Wisinski et al., 2023	NCT02465060	3	accepted	12027	Somatic	2024-04-26 19:10:10 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12027	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5071	false
BRAF V600 OR v::BRAF Fusion	5077	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	0080830		Tovorafenib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 2 clinical trial, the efficacy of RAF inhibitor tovorafenib (DAY-101) was investigated in patients between the ages of 6 months and 25 years, with pediatric low-grade gliomas harbouring BRAF alterations (fusions, rearrangements, or V600 mutations). The trial had two arms, arm 1 (n = 77) tested the efficacy of tovorafenib, while arm 2 (n=60) was an extension cohort, which provided treatment access for patients with RAF altered pLGG after arm 1 closure. The RANO-HGG criteria was used to assess efficacy in patients in arm 1. The overall response rate was 67% (95% CI; 54-78). Specifically, 12 (17%) patients had a complete response, 34 (49%) patients experienced a partial response, and 18 (26%) patients had stable disease as the best response. The ORR in patients with BRAF fusions and BRAF V600E mutations was 69% (95% CI; 56-81) and 50% (95% CI; 19-81) respectively. A relatively higher ORR was noted in patients who had received prior MAPK therapy compared to patients who hadn't received prior MAPK therapy. Specifically, the ORR was 71% (95%CI; 54-84) in patients who had received prior MAPK therapy, and 61% (95% CI; 41-78) in patients who hadn't received prior MAPK therapy. The median PFS reported was 19.4 months (95% CI; 16.9 - NR).	37978284	PubMed		Kilburn et al., 2024	NCT04775485	5	accepted	12028	Somatic	2024-09-13 00:25:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12028	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5077	false

BCR::NTRK2 Fusion	5113	Brain Glioblastoma Multiforme	3073		Entrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4 underwent a craniotomy with gross total resection. A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy.	35673607	PubMed		Grogan et al., 2022		1	accepted	12035	Somatic	2024-07-08 16:32:06 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12035	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5113	false
Kataegis Positive	5119	Breast Cancer	1612				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	In whole genome analysis of tumor and normal tissue from 97 breast cancers from TCGA, 132 kataegis loci were identified, and were enriched in chromosomes 8, 17, and 22, and depleted on chromosomes 2, 9, and 16. A classifier was built to predict presence or absence of kataegis from RNAseq data and the model was applied to 998 TCGA tumors with only RNA-seq data. This analysis classified 180 breast tumors with kataegis and 232 without kataegis with a 95% confidence level. In these 412 patients, kataegis was associated with ER and PR negativity, and HER2 positivity, as well as TP53 mutation and older age of onset. The authors then defined good prognosis as living patients or patients dying after age 55, and poor prognosis as dying before age 55. Kataegis was found as the only variable that significantly contributed to prognosis (p = 0.020, t test) by this approach and also by a cox proportional hazard model approach. The authors also reported that expression in kataegis tumors were more epithelial like and suggest they have lower migration potential.	27373164	PubMed		D'Antonio et al., 2016		3	accepted	12037	Somatic	2024-08-05 19:02:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12037	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5119	false
CK High	5120	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	1040				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In a retrospective study of 5,290 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients where chromosome-banding analysis (CBA) data was available, karyotype complexity was assessed for clinical impact. Karyotypes were classified using 2016 International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. CK was defined as having 3 or more clonal aberrations in the CBA. CK cases were subdivided into 3 subgroups based on whether they were carrying 3 (n = 355 [45%]), 4 (n= 168 [21%]), or >= 5 (n = 271 [34%]) abnormalities. These subgroups were defined as low, intermediate, and high, respectively. The High-CK group had significantly shorter overall survival (median OS, 3.1 years; P < .001) compared with either low-CK or intermediate-CK cases (median OS for low-CK was 12.3 and intermediate-CK was 7.25 years).	30602617	PubMed		Baliakas et al., 2019		3	accepted	12038	Somatic	2024-07-12 17:07:21 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12038	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5120	false
PIK3CA Mutation OR RB1 Mutation OR ESR1 Mutation	5149	Breast Cancer	1612		Fulvestrant,Palbociclib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	In this phase III trial (PALOMA-3), patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Patients were randomized to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant (P+F) or placebo plus fulvestrant (F). A paired ctDNA exome sequencing was conducted to analyze clonal composition. RB1 mutations were identified in 6/127 patients (p=0.041), part of the P + F arm, while no RB1 mutations were identified in the patients treated with fulvestrant alone, at EOT (end of treatment). ESR1 mutations were noted in 25.1% at day 1, and 31.3% of the patients at EOT. An increased proportion of PIK3CA mutations were noted at EOT compared to day 1 (19% v/s 26.7%; p = 0.00069). Additionally, the proportions of patients with new PIK3CA mutations did not differ between the two treatment groups, which suggests that these mutations may play a role in fulvestrant resistance. Strong evidence was reported for positive selection for ESR1 Y537S through the treatment in both treatment groups (p=0.0037), suggesting this mutation may promote resistance to fulvestrant. The data also indicates that resistance to fulvestrant may be a major genetic driver of resistance to the combination treatment.	30206110	PubMed		O'Leary et al., 2018		3	accepted	12045	Somatic	2024-06-11 22:06:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12045	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5149	false
BCR::ABL1 Fusion	1	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With BCR::ABL1 Fusion		Middle age onset,Late young adult onset,Late onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2007 study, the authors identified 38 cases of t(9;22)(q34;q11), also known as Philadelphia positive (Ph+), acute leukemia of myeloid origin. However, 18 cases were excluded as they displayed mixed lineage features, and a further four were excluded as they were considered secondary acute myeloid leukemia. In total, they included 16 cases of Ph+ AML confirmed to be de novo, with an overall incidence of 0.35% among all cases of AML considered in the study. The patients were aged from 30 to 82 years. Using RT-PCR the 12 cases with sufficient material were confirmed to have the BCR::ABL1 fusion transcript. The p210 fusion transcript was detected in 10 cases, while the p190 fusion transcript was detected in the remaining 2 cases. The authors concluded that Ph+ AML has an aggressive clinical course. The authors confirmed the presence of BCR::ABL1 in de novo AML and distinct from cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis.	17369142	PubMed		Soupir et al., 2007		4	accepted	12046	Somatic	2024-07-08 00:06:22 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12046	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1	true

The patients were aged from 27 to 71 years. The cases were observed to have a shorter survival, and immunophenotyping revealed positivity for CD33/CD13 and CD34. Lymphoid-associated markers were found in 7 of 9 cases tested. The authors confirmed a subset of de novo AML carries the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation.	8952155	PubMed		Cuneo et al., 1996		4	accepted	12047	Somatic	2024-07-08 00:09:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12047	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1	true

The cytogenetic aberration t(9;22)(q34;q11) [known to result in a BCR::ABL1 fusion] was detected in 47 cases (0.8%). These patients were aged from 22 to 58 years. The authors found that t(9;22) was associated with significantly poorer overall survival. A subset of AML cases was confirmed to carry the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation.	20385793	PubMed		Grimwade et al., 2010		4	accepted	12048	Somatic	2024-07-08 00:13:50 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12048	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1	true
BRD4::NUTM1 Fusion	5152	NUT Midline Carcinoma	0060463	Middle age onset,Juvenile onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	"In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case. All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from ""NUT midline carcinoma"" to ""NUT carcinoma"". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage."	28643357	PubMed		Lemelle et al., 2017		4	accepted	12049	Somatic	2024-06-14 06:29:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12049	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5152	false
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	NUT Midline Carcinoma	0060463	Adult onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1 fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.	32328562	PubMed		Chau et al., 2020		4	accepted	12050	Somatic	2024-06-14 06:34:29 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12050	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	false
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	NUT Midline Carcinoma	0060463	Juvenile onset,Childhood onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.	15483023	PubMed		French et al., 2004		4	accepted	12051	Somatic	2024-06-14 06:33:02 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12051	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	false

EWSR1::CREB3L1 Fusion	5154	Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma		Late young adult onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.	24441665	PubMed		Arbajian et al., 2014		3	accepted	12057	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12057	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5154	true
EWSR1::CREB3L1 Fusion	5154	Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma		Young adult onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2017 study, the authors utilized SNP arrays, expression profiling, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing to further characterize sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)/SEF hybrid tumors. The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.	28939748	PubMed		Arbajian et al., 2017		3	accepted	12058	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12058	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5154	true
EWSR1::CREB3L1 Fusion	5154	Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma		Adult onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2015 study, the authors aimed to further characterize the molecular characteristics of pure sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and hybrid SEF/low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) lesions using FISH and/or RNA-Seq. A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18–78). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case. On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged).	25231134	PubMed		Prieto-Granada et al., 2015		3	accepted	12059	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12059	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5154	true

Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.	24441665	PubMed		Arbajian et al., 2014		3	accepted	12060	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12060	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5155	true

FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS. The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.	17721195	PubMed		Guillou et al., 2007		4	accepted	12061	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12061	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5155	true
FUS::CREB3L2 Fusion	5155	Low-grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma		Young adult onset,Middle age onset,Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this study, an RT-PCR assay detected a FUS::CREB3L2 transcript in 14 of 16 (88%) low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) cases, whereas the fusion was not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors (including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas). Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases.

Of these, all eight cases with material available for methylation profiling were classified as 'high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration' (HGNET-MN1). Chromosome copy number profiles were analyzed using the methylation array data and notable losses included chromosomes 22q (in 1 of 8 cases), 14 (in 3 of 8 cases), and broad regions of X (in 2 of 8 cases). All cases harbored an unmethylated MGMT promoter region. A mixture of low- and high-grade histology was observed, with characteristic histological features including increased vascular and general hyalinization/sclerosis, with an absence of eosinophilic granular bodies. OLIG2 immunostaining was positive in a majority of cases (8 of 10), with a striking female preponderance (9 of 10) noted.	30876455	PubMed		Lehman et al., 2019		4	accepted	12078	Somatic	2024-07-29 20:00:12 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12078	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5187	false
MN1 Rearrangement	5187	Astroblastoma, MN1-altered	0080904	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset,Childhood onset			Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	In an analysis of 27 histologically defined astroblastomas, 10 had MN1 rearrangements, 7 had BRAF p.V600E mutations, 2 had RELA rearrangements, and 8 had none of these drivers identified. Astroblastoma, MN1-altered showed significantly increased overall survival compared to those histologically defined astroblastomas with BRAF p.V600E mutations (p=0.013). When compared to histologically defined astroblastomas without driver mutations, overall survival in astroblastoma, MN1-altered was increased but did not reach statistical significance due to the low number of patients. The mean overall survival of astroblastoma MN1-altered was 138 months (68 to 221 months, n=7) compared to 2 to 141 months (mean, 61 months; n = 7) for patients with BRAF V600E. Given the favorable prognosis, the authors suggest a more conservative approach in this tumor type.	30876455	PubMed		Lehman et al., 2019		4	accepted	12079	Somatic	2024-07-29 20:01:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12079	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5187	false

Of the 125 cases with suitable karyotypes, 5 were confirmed by re-examination of the karyograms or FISH analysis to have the t(7;12)(q36;p13) also known as MNX1::ETV6 (previously known as HLXB9::ETV6). The authors noted that the 5 cases were aged between 0 and 18 months of age, and represented 5/23 cases in this age group without Down syndrome. The authors also included a further 5 cases with (7;12)(q36;p13) after re-examination of other archived karyotype databases.

MNX1::ETV6 Fusion	5195	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With MNX1::ETV6 Fusion		Infantile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2006 study, the authors examined cytogenetics for the presence of a 7q31-36 and 12p11-13 chromosomal abnormality in 320 infants and pediatric ALL and AML patients younger than 36 months of age. Of the 59 AML cases 6 patients (aged 2 to 18 months) were found to harbor the t(7;12)(q36;p12) also known as MNX1::ETV6 (previously known as HLXB9::ETV6), and represented 5/18 patients with infant AML (0 to 12 months of age). One infant ALL case also harbored the t(7;12)(q36;p13). All t(7;12)-positive AML samples had an additional copy of chromosome 19. Four t(7;12)-positive cases were confirmed by RT-PCR to have a fusion of HLXB9 (MNX1) exon 1 to ETV6 exon 3. The authors conclude that the t(7;12)(q36;p13) is almost exclusively present in infant AML and is often associated with a gain of chromosome 19.	16646086	PubMed		von Bergh et al., 2006		3	accepted	12092	Somatic	2024-08-18 18:45:18 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12092	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5195	true
MNX1::ETV6 Fusion	5195	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With MNX1::ETV6 Fusion		Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2018 study, the authors included 651 pediatric patients diagnosed with AML. Seven patients were found to have a t(7;12)(q36;p13) also known as MNX1::ETV6 (previously known as HLXB9::ETV6), with the median age at diagnosis being 6 months (range 2 to 8 months), and representing 8.6% of AML patients below one year of age. All seven children were also found to have a gain of chromosome 19. The authors conclude that t(7;12)(q36;p13) should be considered as a specific AML subgroup in the WHO classification.	29569294	PubMed		Espersen et al., 2018		3	accepted	12093	Somatic	2024-08-18 18:46:13 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12093	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5195	true
BRD4::NUTM1 Fusion	5152	NUT Midline Carcinoma	0060463		Panobinostat		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	BRD4-NUT fusion was found to be associated with globally decreased histone acetylation and transcriptional repression in gain-of-expression and loss-of-expression assays. Following these results, it was postulated that chromatin acetylation would be restored by treatment of the cell lines with HDACi. In vivo efficacy of HDACi (LBH-589) was tested in 2 luciferized NMC cell line xenograft models (TC-797, PER-403) and significant suppression of tumour growth was noted in both models.	21447744	PubMed		Schwartz et al., 2011		3	accepted	12099	Somatic	2024-09-06 21:25:54 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12099	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5152	false
NTRK1 Amplification	1254	Esophageal Carcinoma	1107		Larotrectinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 71-year-old male with esophageal carcinoma harboring NTRK1 amplification, based on FoundationOne CDx profiling test, was treated with larotrectinib. Treatment with larotrectinib led to a shrinkage of the primary tumor, in addition to liver and lung metastases within 6 weeks based on RECIST criteria. This was also accompanied by tumor marker decrease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma [SCC]). An increase in SCC and disease progression was observed in patient 3 months after starting on larotrectinib, which could likely be associated with a drop in NTRK1 levels below the limit of detection. These results indicate that larotrectinib may be efficacious in cases with NTRK1 gene amplification.	32323889	PubMed		Hempel et al., 2020		3	accepted	12120	Somatic	2025-01-23 23:30:14 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12120	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1254	false

Patients who received lazertinib-amivantamab combination therapy had a significantly higher median PFS compared to patients who received osimertinib monotherapy (23.7 months vs. 16.6 months; HR 0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.85; p < 0.001]). Additionally, amivantamab-lazertinib prolonged PFS vs. osimertinib in patients with a history of brain metastases (18.3 months vs. 13.0 months; HR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.92]). In 136 patients with liver metastases at baseline, the median PFS was significantly prolonged in patients treated with amivantamab-lazertinib (18.2 months, 95% CI, 13.1-NE) compared to patients treated with osimertinib (11.0 months, 95% CI, 7.4-12.8), while the HR for disease progression in the amivantamab-lazertinib versus osimertinib groups was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.91, p = 0.017).	38942080	PubMed		Felip et al., 2024		4	accepted	12131	Somatic	2024-10-28 17:37:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12131	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4432	false

KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion	5267	AML With KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion		Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This is an international retrospective study by International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (I-BFM) AML study group including 543 pediatric AML patients from 18 countries diagnosed between 1995-2005. The authors recorded 62 pediatric AML patients with t(8;16)(p11;p13) determined by karyotyping, FISH and/or RT-PCR. Complete karyotypes were available for 57/62 cases, of which 22 (38.6%) showed additional non-recurrent cytogenetic aberrations. The t(8;16)(p11;p13) results in a fusion of exons 15 or 16 of KAT6A (also known as MOZ or MYST3, located to chromosome 8p11) to exon 3-8 of CREBBP (located to chromosome 16p13). Both proteins encoded by the KAT6A and CREBBP fusion partners have histone methyltransferase activity and are involved in cell cycle and transcriptional regulation. Pediatric AML cases with the KAT6A::CREBBP fusion showed specific clinical manifestations, including young age at diagnosis (median of 1.2 years), considerable frequency of leukemia cutis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, erythrophagocytosis and intermediate survival rate. Interestingly, seven neonatal AML cases with t(8;16)(p11;p13) showed spontaneous remission. The study also included gene expression analysis for 297 pediatric AML patients; differentially expressed genes were validated for 30 cases by quantitative RT-PCR. Gene expression signature of pediatric AML with t(8;16) showed similar clustering pattern as KMT2A (MLL)- rearranged AML cases with HOXA and RET genes up-regulation. The overexpression of HOXA and RET genes have been reported in adult AML with t(8;16) as well, indicating similarities in the expression profile between pediatric and adult AML with t(8;16).	23974201	PubMed		Coenen et al., 2013		4	accepted	12153	Somatic	2024-11-03 02:00:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12153	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5267	true
KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion	5267	AML With KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion		Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This manuscript is the first report of a unique expression profile in pediatric AML with KAT6A::CREBBP gene fusion (known also as MOZ::CBP or MYST3::CREBBP). Genomic studies and gene expression profile analysis were performed for a de novo AML M5b diagnosed in a 10-year-old girl. Pathology evaluation showed 23% blast in peripheral blood and 80% blasts in bone marrow. Karyotype and FISH confirmed the t(8;16)(p11;p13), resulting in the KAT6A::CREBBP fusion, as the sole chromosome abnormality. Gene expression analysis results for this case were compared with five non-t(8;16) pediatric AML cases (two M1, one M4, two M5), and adult cases with t(8;16)(p11;p13). The gene expression profile of adult and pediatric AMLs with KAT6A::CREBBP fusion were similar, and shared features with the AML or T-ALL with KMT2A-rearrangements. The expression signature was characterized by upregulation of HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXA11, LMO2, PTPN6 and GFI1 genes. It was proposed that overexpression of HOXA genes confers self-renewal capacity and stem-cell properties to blasts, and is responsible for poor outcome, in AML with t(8;16).	20630590	PubMed		Serravalle et al., 2010		3	accepted	12154	Somatic	2024-11-03 02:04:03 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12154	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5267	true
KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion	5267	AML With KAT6A::CREBBP Fusion		Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	The authors reported a congenital AML case with leukemia cutis and a cryptic insertional t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3)/KAT6A::CREBBP fusion identified exclusively by FISH. They found KAT6A::CREBBP fusion in 11.4% of nuclei by Interphase FISH. The authors combined chromosome, interphase, and metaphase FISH results. FISH analysis showed a cryptic, insertional translocation event resulting in a KAT6A::CREBBP fusion on an apparently normal 16p. The authors discuss that pediatric AML cases with KAT6A::CREBBP fusion over 1 month of age have similar clinical manifestations, but with poorer clinical outcomes compared with congenital cases. Spontaneous remission has been reported in about 50% of congenital AML cases with t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3) and in case of recurrence, patients would have favorable response to standard therapy. This case report illustrates several unique characteristics of AML with t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3) including congenital onset, cryptic form of the rearrangement and manifestation as leukemia cutis.	28097792	PubMed		Barrett et al., 2017		3	accepted	12155	Somatic	2024-11-27 20:42:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12155	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5267	true

These patients were then randomized 2:2:1 to receive amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy (n=263), chemotherapy (n=263), or amivantamab-chemotherapy (n=131). PFS was significantly longer in the amivantamab-chemotherapy [median 6.3 months; HR 0.48, p <0.001] and the amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy [median 8.3 months; HR 0.44, p <0.001] groups compared to chemotherapy alone [median 4.2 months]. Additionally, ORR was also significantly higher in the amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy groups at, 64% (95% CI 55-72) and 63% (95% CI 57-69) respectively, compared to the chemotherapy group alone at 36% (p < 0.001 for both).	37879444	PubMed		Passaro et al., 2024		4	accepted	12156	Somatic	2024-10-23 19:18:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12156	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4432	false
RET Mutation	1598	Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma	3973		Selpercatinib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase III trial, 291 patients (12 years or older) with medullary thyroid cancer harbouring RET mutations were treated with selpercatinib. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive selpercatinib (n=193) or cabozantinib/vandetanib (control group, n=98). Progression-free survival in the selpercatinib group was 86.8% (95% CI, 79.8-91.6) and 65.7% (95% CI, 51.9-76.4) in the control group at 12 months. Additionally, median treatment failure-free survival was not reached in the selpercatinib group and was 13.9 months in the control group (HR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.15-0.42, p <0.001), as assessed by blinded independent central review. Treatment failure-free survival at 12 months was 86.2% (95% CI 79.1-91.0) in the treatment group, and 62.1% (95% CI, 48.9-72.8) in the control group. Finally, the ORR in the treatment and control group was 69.4% (95% CI, 48.9-72.8) and 38.8% (95% CI, 29.1-49.2) respectively. Overall, treatment with selpercatinib resulted in significantly better PFS compared to cabozantinib/vandetanib treatment in patients with progression, advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer.	37870969	PubMed		Hadoux et al., 2023	NCT04211337	4	accepted	12157	Somatic	2024-10-23 19:36:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12157	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1598	false
MTAP Deletion	4644	Solid Tumor			PRMT5 Inhibitor AMG 193		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 1 trial, 80 patients harbouring MTAP deletions/CDKN2A deletions received AMG 193 in a dose escalation study. The most common tumour types were PDAC (23.8%), NSCLC (17.5%), biliary tract cancer (BCT) (8.8%), GBM (6.3%) and gastric/esophageal cancer (2.5%). Of the 80 patients, 6 patients had MTAP-intact per central IHC and were therefore excluded from the efficacy analysis. The ORR was 21.4% (95% CI, 10.3-36.8), and the DCR was 54.8% (95% CI, 38.7-70.2). The median time to response (TTR) was 3.6 months (3.6-3.7) in the 800 mg QD cohort and 1.8 months in the 1200 mg QD cohort. The median DOR across all the cohorts was 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.7 - NE) with the longest being 12.9 months in a patient with RCC and 11.0 months in a patient with ovarian SLCT, and the median DoDC was 9.2 months (95% CI, 4.9-11.8). Finally, SDMA reduction (to near complete elimination) was noted in post-treatment biopsies from eight MTAP-deleted patients compared to pre-treatment biopsies at dose levels of 480 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg. Overall, encouraging anti-tumour activity of AMG 193 was noted in MTAP-deleted solid tumours between 800 mg and 1200 mg dose, with a manageable safety profile, and no dose-limiting cytopenia events reported.	39293516	PubMed		Rodon et al., 2024		3	accepted	12158	Somatic	2024-10-21 17:27:58 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12158	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4644	false
BRAF V600E	12	Solid Tumor			Trametinib,Dabrafenib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this trial, patients with advanced rare tumours harbouring BRAF V600E mutations were treated with a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. The study included eight distinct cohorts: anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) (n=36), biliary tract cancer (BTC)(n=43), gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) (n=1), adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (ASI) (n=3), low-grade glioma (LGG) (n=13), high-grade glioma (HGG)(n=45), hairy cell leukemia(HCL) (n=55), and multiple myeloma (MM)(n=19). The overall response rates for these cohorts were 56%, 53%, 0%, 67%, 54%, 33%, 89%, and 50% respectively. The median duration of response varied, with 14.4 months for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, 8.9 months for biliary tract cancer, 7.7 months for adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, 31.2 months for high-grade glioma, and 11.1 months in multiple myeloma. In the remaining cohorts, the duration of response was not reached. Progression-free survival was measured at 6.7 months for ATC, 9.0 months for BTC, 9.5 months for ASI, 5.5 months for HGG, and 6.3 months for MM. PFS could not be evaluated in the LGG and HCL groups due to small patient numbers. The overall survival was 14.5 months for ATC, 13.5 months for BTC, 17.6 months for HGG, 21.8 months for ASI, and 33.9 months for MM cohorts. OS could not be evaluated for the LGG and HCL groups due to a low number of deaths. Adverse events were reported in 97.6% of the patients (n=201), with 87.9% (n=181) of these being related to the study treatment. Serious adverse events occurred in 45.1% (n=93) of patients across all cohorts.	37059834	PubMed		Subbiah et al., 2023	NCT02034110	4	accepted	12161	Somatic	2025-01-24 17:19:02 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12161	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false

TCF3::HLF Fusion	5334	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With TCF3::HLF Fusion		Pediatric onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2018 study the authors investigated B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) RNA-seq data from 1,223 cases enrolled in various clinical trials across multiple centers. The patients were predominantly pediatric patients, aged 0-18 years old. Patient samples were collected from several groups, including the Lund University Hospital cohort (cohort 2), the Singapore and Malaysia MaSpore cohort (cohort 4), and the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group cohort (cohort 3), providing a diverse representation of childhood BCP ALL cases. Six cases (0.5%) with a TCF3::HLF gene fusion were identified, all in female pediatric patients, and one case with a TCF4::HLF fusion. Both TCF3::HLF and TCF4::HLF retained part of the HLF bZIP_2 domain and displayed significant up-regulated expression of HLF. The authors found that TCF3::HLF is a rare fusion associated with high-risk B-ALL.	30487223	PubMed		Li et al., 2018		3	accepted	12169	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:04:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12169	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5334	true
TCF3::HLF Fusion	5334	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With TCF3::HLF Fusion		Pediatric onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2023 study the authors investigated the occurrence and spectrum of TCF3 gene rearrangements in 203 patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), aged 0-18. The study utilized fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to screen for chromosomal abnormalities, revealing that 2.0% (4 out of 203) of cases harbored a t(17;19)(q21-q22;p13.3) rearrangement, which was confirmed through additional FISH analyses. Direct Sanger sequencing revealed the complex nature of t(17;19)(q21-q22;p13.3) in three cases, with the formation of a chimeric product involving TCF3 exon 16 and HLF exon 4 as well as non-template insertions by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The reading frame was preserved in all cases and the bZIP motif of the HLF protein retained. TCF3::HLF was associated with significantly lower survival rates.	37058324	PubMed		Zerkalenkova et al., 2023		3	accepted	12170	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:04:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12170	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5334	true
TCF3::HLF Fusion	5334	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With TCF3::HLF Fusion		Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2015 study the authors applied genome and RNA sequencing to analyze a cohort of five diagnostic pre-treatment samples from patients aged between 7 and 17 years, all diagnosed with TCF3::HLF positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The samples were collected from pediatric oncology centers across the United States, ensuring a diverse representation of clinical cases. The study found that TCF3 breakpoints were clustered in two specific intronic regions of the TCF3 gene. Type 1 translocations were identified in two patients, involving intron 16, which connected TCF3 exon 16 to HLF exon 4. These translocations included inserted non-template and intronic sequences, as well as new splice acceptor sites. Conversely, Type 2 translocations, observed in three patients, involved intron 15, linking TCF3 exon 15 to HLF exon 4. Monoallelic PAX5 deletions were enriched in TCF3::HLF positive ALL, detected in 3/5 cases compared to being generally observed in 13% of ALL cases, and PAX5 expression was reduced in all TCF3::HLF positive cases. The authors concluded that the TCF3::HLF fusion likely occurs in B lymphoid progenitors within the context of PAX5 haploinsufficiency. This genetic background is associated with transcriptional reprogramming towards an immature, hybrid hematopoietic state, highlighting the importance of these genetic alterations in the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of TCF3::HLF positive ALL.	26214592	PubMed		Fischer et al., 2015		4	accepted	12171	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:04:49 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12171	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5334	true
CEBPA Mutation	29	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CEBPA Mutation		Pediatric onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2021 study, the authors investigated the role of CEBPA mutations in the diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric and young adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2958 patients enrolled in Children’s Oncology Group trials. Patients were aged 0-29 years old. CEBPA mutations were identified in 160/2958 cases (5.4%). 132 (82.5%) cases had two CEBPA mutations, one in the transactivation domain (TAD) and the other in the basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain (CEBPA-double-mutated [CEBPA-dm]). 28 cases (17.5%) had a single CEBPA mutation in the bZip region (CEBPA-bZip). CEBPA bZIP and CEBPA-dm AML cases were typically characterized by higher white blood cell counts and normal karyotypes, had a characteristic pattern of secondary mutations frequently involving CSF3R and GATA2, had a unique expression profile, and were associated with a favorable outcome. It was confirmed that both CEBPA-bZip and CEBPA-dm cases have shared clinical and molecular features and were both associated with a favorable prognosis, which had not been established for pediatric AML before this study. The key finding is thus that CEBPA-bZip mutation is sufficient to drive this leukemia and should be considered as the defining molecular lesion for CEBPA mutant AML. Isolated CEBPA-TAD mutations were rare. Overall, this study highlights the importance of CEBPA abnormalities (specifically CEBPA-bZip mutations) in defining a type of pediatric AML associated with a favorable outcome.	33951732	PubMed		Tarlock et al., 2021		3	accepted	12172	Somatic	2024-12-01 00:00:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12172	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/29	true
CEBPA Mutation	29	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CEBPA Mutation		Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2022 study, the authors highlighted the diagnostic significance of different types of CEBPA mutations in 4,708 adult AML patients, recruited into the Study Alliance Leukemia trials and spanning a broad age range from under 30 to over 70 years. The study differentiated patients with CEBPA mutant AML based on mutation type: among 240 CEBPA mutant AML cases (5.1% of all cases), 60 had a single mutation in the N-terminal transactivation domains (CEBPAsmTAD), 49 had a single mutation in the C-terminal DNA-binding basic leucine zipper region (CEBPAsmbZIP), and 131 had both N-terminal TAD and C-terminal bZIP mutations (biallelic CEBPA, or CEBPA bi). Patients with CEBPAbi or CEBPAsmbZIP mutations showed distinct clinical characteristics compared to CEBPAsmTAD and CEBPA wild-type cases, including younger age and higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis. The study underscores the value of detailed CEBPA mutation analysis in AML diagnosis, by showing that CEBPAsmbZIP and CEBPA-bi define molecular subtype of disease with unique biologic and clinical characteristics, while CEBPAsmTAD represent non-specific changes.	34320176	PubMed		Taube et al., 2022		4	accepted	12173	Somatic	2024-12-01 00:00:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12173	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/29	true
CEBPA Mutation	29	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CEBPA Mutation		Young adult onset,Middle age onset,Pediatric onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2022 study, the authors investigated the diagnostic significance of CEBPA mutations in AML, focusing on data from a large cohort of 1,028 patients aged 70 years or younger from the Japanese Multi-center Collaborative Sequencing Program. The study underscores that the location of CEBPA mutations is crucial in identifying specific AML subtypes. Among the 1,028 patients, 59 had a CEBPA single mutation (CEBPAsm) and 103 had a CEBPA double mutation (CEBPAdm). Of the CEBPAdm cases, 91.3% (94 of 103) had one mutation in the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, while 32.2% (19 of 59) of the CEBPAsm cases had a bZIP mutation. The study reinforces the role of CEBPA mutational analysis as an essential diagnostic tool in AML, particularly in differentiating between single and double mutations and their locations within the gene. The presence of bZIP mutations, whether single or double, provides unique diagnostic markers and refines risk stratification, aiding in developing more personalized treatment strategies for AML patients based on their specific CEBPA mutation profile.	34448807	PubMed		Wakita et al., 2022		4	accepted	12174	Somatic	2024-12-01 00:00:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12174	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/29	true
MEF2D::v Fusion	5292	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MEF2D Rearrangement		Pediatric onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This international, multi-center retrospective analysis examined characteristics of 107 cases of B- lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with MEF2D gene rearrangements (MEF2D-r), gathering information from 14 different regional study groups. The strength of this study was the collection of a large, well-annotated cohort of MEF2D-positive cases, allowing a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics associated with MEF2D-r. Most patients in this study were classified as high-risk based on their clinical characteristics, with approximately 70% meeting the National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk criteria. The median age of patients was 10.67 years, and the most common fusion partners identified were BCL9 and HNRNPUL1, accounting for 85% of the cases. The study demonstrated that MEF2D fusions in B-ALL lead to shared specific features, and are associated with female sex, older age, an atypical immunophenotype (characterized by expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin u chain and CD5, along with less frequent expression of CD10), and an unfavorable outcome.	36309560	PubMed		Ohki et al., 2023		3	accepted	12176	Somatic	2024-11-24 00:00:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12176	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5292	true
MEF2D::v Fusion	5292	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MEF2D Rearrangement		Juvenile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study gathered diagnostic and prognostic data from pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients stored in the Tokyo Children’s Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) biobank. Among the 328 selected RNA samples from B-ALL patients, 16 cases of ALL and 1 case of lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) harboring MEF2D fusions were identified. The MEF2D fusions included MEF2D::BCL9 (n=10), MEF2D::HNRNPUL1 (n=6), and one novel MEF2D::HNRNPH1 fusion. MEF2D fusion B-ALL patients aged between 3 and 15 years. This study identified MEF2D fusions at an incidence of approximately 2% in the B-ALL cohort. MEF2D fusion cases had a gene expression signature significantly distinct from other genetic subtypes of B-ALL; they were mutually exclusive with other subtypes defining primary genetic drivers, further emphasizing the diagnostic relevance of MEF2D fusions in B-ALL classification.	30171027	PubMed		Ohki et al., 2019		4	accepted	12178	Somatic	2024-11-24 00:00:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12178	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5292	true
MEF2D::v Fusion	5292	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MEF2D Rearrangement		Pediatric onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	The paper explores the diagnostic significance of MEF2D gene fusions in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), identifying them as important markers for a specific subgroup of the disease. RNA sequencing of 560 B-ALL cases revealed MEF2D fusions in 22 instances, with MEF2D::BCL9 fusion being the most prevalent (16/22 cases), with other fusion partners including CSF1R, DAZAP1, HNRNPUL1, and SS18. The age range of patients with MEF2D fusions was as follows: 15 cases (4.1%) were children up to 15 years old, 4 cases (6.5%) were adolescents aged 16–20 years, 2 cases (2.7%) were young adults, and 1 case was identified among 56 older adults. Further analysis of an expanded cohort of 1,164 cases confirmed that MEF2D fusions were present in approximately 5.3% of B-ALL cases that do not have other known primary alterations; FOXJ2 was identified as an additional MEF2D partner gene in the extended cohort. The study showed that B-ALLs with MEF2D fusions had a distinct gene expression profile and immunophenotype, along with frequent copy number changes at breakpoint sites within MEF2D and its partner genes. These MEF2D fusion cases were associated with poorer outcomes, highlighting their potential as diagnostic markers for a high-risk B-ALL subtype.	27824051	PubMed		Gu et al., 2016		4	accepted	12199	Somatic	2024-11-24 00:00:35 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12199	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5292	true
CEBPA Mutation	29	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CEBPA Mutation					Diagnostic	Supports	D	Positive	In this 2019 study, the authors investigated the diagnostic significance of CEBPA mutations in AML by analyzing how the order of these mutations influences disease development in a mouse model that replicates human AML transcriptionally and morphologically. The study reveals that when CEBPA mutations occur before CSF3R mutations, they drive leukemogenesis by blocking myeloid differentiation, resulting in AML. Enhancer and transcription factor motif analysis demonstrated that wild-type CEBPA activates differentiation-related enhancers, while mutant CEBPA disrupts this pathway. Additionally, RNA-seq data show that CSF3R mutations alone promote differentiation, whereas early CEBPA mutations lead to a stem/progenitor-like phenotype with heightened cell cycle activity. In mouse models, cells with early CEBPA mutations progress to aggressive, immature leukemia, contrasting with the slower, partially differentiated progression seen with initial CSF3R mutations. These findings underscore the role of CEBPA mutations as primary oncogenic events in AML pathogenesis.	31784538	PubMed		Braun et al., 2019		3	accepted	12200	Somatic	2024-12-01 00:00:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12200	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/29	true
CEBPA Mutation	29	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With CEBPA Mutation		Young adult onset,Pediatric onset			Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	In this 2021 study, the authors examined the prognostic implications of CEBPA mutations in pediatric and young adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by analyzing 2958 patients enrolled in Children’s Oncology Group trials. CEBPA mutations were found in 160/2958 cases (5.4%), with 132 (82.5%) cases having biallelic mutations (CEBPA-dm) and 28 (17.5%) cases having a single mutation in the basic leucine zipper (bZip) region (CEBPA-bZip). Both CEBPA-bZip and CEBPA-dm mutations were associated with favorable outcomes, including event-free survival (EFS) of 64% and overall survival (OS) rates of 81% and 89%, respectively. These rates were significantly higher than those in patients with CEBPA wild-type AML (EFS of 46% and OS of 61%). The study highlighted that the prognosis for both CEBPA-bZip and CEBPA-dm cases was similarly favorable, emphasizing that the presence of a CEBPA-bZip mutation alone is sufficient to predict a positive outcome. This finding challenged previous assumptions and provided new insight into the prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in AML. In conclusion, this study establishes the favorable prognostic significance of CEBPA-bZip mutations in AML and underscores the importance of these mutations in the prognosis of pediatric AML.	33951732	PubMed		Tarlock et al., 2021		4	accepted	12231	Somatic	2024-12-08 00:00:42 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12231	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/29	true
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With NUTM1 Rearrangement		Juvenile onset,Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2019 study, the authors investigated the association between NUTM1 rearrangements and B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in a cohort of pediatric and infant patients, up to 14 years of age. NUTM1 fusions were identified in 5 pediatric cases and 2 infant cases, resulting in the expression of NUTM1, a gene typically not expressed in leukemic lymphoblasts. The fusion partners identified included SLC12A6, CUX1, IKZF1, and ACIN1. These fusion events were detected in B-ALL cases that did not harbor primary genetic aberrations typically associated with leukemia, such as ETV6::RUNX1 or BCR::ABL1 fusions. Furthermore, the study found that NUTM1 fusions were linked to high gene expression on chromosome band 10p12.31-12.2, including BMI1, suggesting that these fusions are associated with a unique expression profile. The study concluded that NUTM1 fusions were present in 2.4% of pediatric B-ALL cases without sentinel cytogenetic abnormalities and defined a new genetic subtype of B-ALL.	30872366	PubMed		Hormann et al., 2019		4	accepted	12237	Somatic	2024-12-17 20:16:46 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12237	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	true
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With NUTM1 Rearrangement		Juvenile onset,Infantile onset,Childhood onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2021 study, the authors examined the diagnostic features of NUTM1-rearranged B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in a cohort of infants and children. Among 161 KMT2A-wildtype infants, 21.7% were identified with NUTM1 rearrangements, detected through RNA sequencing and other molecular diagnostic techniques. The study extended the analysis to a cohort of 85 cases, which included 35 infants under 1 year of age and 50 children aged 1–15 years, sourced from the Interfant and Ponte di Legno study groups. The median age at diagnosis was 5.6 months for infants and 4 years for children, with infants more frequently presenting with elevated white blood cell counts (≥50×10⁹/L). NUTM1-rearranged B-ALL was characterized by increased expression of the nearly complete open reading frame of NUTM1 fused to various partners, including BRD9, which was exclusively observed in pro-B ALL cases. These fusions were associated with unique gene expression profiles, including upregulation of BMI1 and, in some cases, HOXA cluster genes. Importantly, NUTM1 rearrangements were mutually exclusive with common leukemia-associated aberrations, such as KMT2A rearrangements, deletions in ETV6, PAX5, or CDKN2A/B, and other sentinel genetic changes, emphasizing their distinct role in the molecular landscape of B-ALL.	34211097	PubMed		Boer et al., 2021		4	accepted	12238	Somatic	2024-12-15 00:00:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12238	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	true
v::NUTM1 Fusion	5151	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With NUTM1 Rearrangement		Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This 2021 study highlights the diagnostic significance of NUTM1 rearrangements in infants with B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) negative for KMT2A rearrangements. Among the 30 analyzed cases of KMT2A-negative B-ALL, fusion genes were detected in 73% of the cohort, with NUTM1 rearrangements being the most frequent, identified in 9 cases (30%). The fusion partners associated with NUTM1 included ACIN1 (n=5), CUX1 (n=2), BRD9 (n=1), and ZNF618 (n=1). Diagnostic molecular profiling was performed using techniques such as split-signal FISH, multiplex RT-PCR, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, and a custom NGS panel targeting 95 leukemia-related genes. The analysis revealed a distinct immunophenotypic profile for cases with NUTM1 fusions. These cases predominantly exhibited a CD10-positive immunophenotype (93%) and had favorable clinical diagnostic features, including low white blood cell counts (<300×10⁹/L) and prednisone good response (PGR) during initial therapy. These findings emphasize the role of NUTM1 rearrangements as a diagnostic marker for a specific molecular subgroup enriched among KMT2A-negative infant B-ALL cases.	33512459	PubMed		Fazio et al., 2021		4	accepted	12239	Somatic	2024-12-15 00:00:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12239	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5151	true
IGH::IL3 Fusion	5335	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With IGH::IL3		Childhood onset,Middle age onset,Juvenile onset,Young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2019 study, the authors included 8 patients with B-ALL presenting with t(5;14)(q31;q32) and reviewed another 16 patients from the literature. The median age at onset was 14.3 years (range of 4 to 60) and were predominately male (20 males versus 4 females). Eosinophilia-related symptoms frequently occurred. The IGH::IL3 fusion was assumed from karyotype or proven by PCR or next-generation sequencing. A deletion of IKZF1 was also detected in 5 of the 7 analyzed cases. The authors conclude there is a subset of IGH-rearranged B-ALL cases with t(5;14)(q31;q32) and clinical features that result from the associated eosinophilia.	31921638	PubMed		Fournier et al., 2019		3	accepted	12243	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:04:53 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12243	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5335	true
IGH::IL3 Fusion	5335	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With IGH::IL3		Juvenile onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 2021 study the authors include four B-ALL cases with an IGH::IL3 gene fusion that initially were unable to be fully characterized by conventional methods. Patients' ages ranged from 6 to 19 years and consisted of 3 males and 1 female. The patients presented with elevated eosinophils and had normal karyotypes. An IGH rearrangement was detected by utilizing an IGH break-apart FISH probe for 3 patients and the IGH::IL3 gene fusion was confirmed in all four patients with next-generation sequencing assay. The patient negative for an IGH rearrangement by FISH had an insertion of the IL3 gene into the IGH region. The authors conclude that there is significant utility of next-generation sequencing techniques for B-ALL with normal conventional chromosome studies and IGH::IL3 cases may be underreported in patients with B-ALL.	33991782	PubMed		Guenzel et al., 2021		4	accepted	12244	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:04:57 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12244	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5335	true
IGH::IL3 Fusion	5335	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With IGH::IL3					Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	In this 1989 study the authors analyzed the bone marrow aspirate from a B-ALL patient presenting with eosinophilia in the peripheral blood and found to have the t(5;14)(q31;q32) chromosomal translocation. Using cloning and nucleic acid sequencing they were able to confirm the juxtaposition of the IL3 gene and the IgH gene. The authors conclude that there is a rare distinct clinical form of acute leukemia with the t(5;14)(q31;q32) that joins the promotor of the IL3 gene to the IgH gene that likely increases transcription of a structurally normal IL3 gene.	2499362	PubMed		Grimaldi et al., 1989		2	accepted	12245	Somatic	2025-01-14 17:05:02 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12245	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5335	true
LRP1B Loss-of-function	5328	Solid Tumor			Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this trial, 101 patients with solid tumours, including lung, prostate, sarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer, harbouring LRP1B alterations were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Most patients (91%) received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, while the remaining were treated with a combination of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 54% in patients with LRP1B pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants (n=46), compared to 13% in those with variants of unknown significance (VUS) (n=55). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.2–23) in the P/LP group versus 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.8–4.3) in the VUS group. Similarly, median overall survival (OS) was 15.5 months (95% CI: 10.3–25.1) in the P/LP group compared to 9.5 months (95% CI: 7.6–21.3) in the VUS group. Overall, the study reported better outcomes with ICI therapy in patients with P/LP LRP1B alterations than in those with VUS, irrespective of tumour mutational burden (TMB) or microsatellite instability (MSI) status.	33653800	PubMed		Brown et al., 2021		3	accepted	12252	Somatic	2025-01-13 16:57:17 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12252	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5328	false
v::IRF4 Fusion	5326	Large B-cell Lymphoma With IRF4 Rearrangement		Juvenile onset,Childhood onset,Adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2011 study the authors screened B-cell lymphomas for a FISH pattern indicating an IGH break but lacking known common partners. After identifying the t(6;14)(p25;q32) with long distance inverse PCR the authors suspected IR4, a known B-cell regulator, may have been juxtaposed to the IGH locus leading to a deregulation of IRF4 expression. Overall in the study using FISH probes for IRF4, a total of 23 lymphomas with IRF4 breakpoints were identified (17 cases with IGH::IRF4, 2 with IGL::IRF4, 1 with IGK::IRF4 and 3 where the partner remained unproven or ambiguous). Ages of the patients diagnosed with an IG::IRF4-positive lymphoma ranged from 4 to 79 years, however these lymphomas were more frequent in children with a median age of 12 years. The IG::IRF4-positive lymphomas were mostly classified histopathologically as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but some were classified as follicular lymphoma (FL). By immunohistochemistry the IG::IRF4-positive lymphomas were mostly characterized by a MUM1+ (MUM1 protein encoded by the IRF4 gene)/BCL6+/BLIMP1− pattern. The authors conclude that there is a novel recurrent translocation that juxtaposes the IRF4 oncogene next to one of the immunoglobulin (IG) loci that activate the transcription factor IRF4 in a subset of mature B-cell lymphomas.	21487109	PubMed		Salaverria et al., 2011		4	accepted	12253	Somatic	2025-01-12 00:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12253	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5326	true
v::IRF4 Fusion	5326	Large B-cell Lymphoma With IRF4 Rearrangement		Juvenile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2020 study the authors included FFPE tumour tissue of patients <18 years of age with morphological follicular lymphoma (FL) and/or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). FISH studies with IRF4 break-apart probes identified 7/34 (21%) patients with a positive IRF4 chromosomal rearrangement, with 4/7 cases confirmed as an IGH::IRF4 fusion. The patients were aged from 5 to 14 years. All seven cases of IRF4 breakpoint-positive FL/DLBCL cases were positive for MUM1 (protein encoded by the IRF4 gene) expression by immunohistochemistry. The IRF4-positive lymphoma frequently present as localised disease and involvement of the tonsils or nasopharynx occurred in 5 of the 7 cases. The authors conclude that all cases of MUM1-positive FL or DLBCL in children and adolescents should be tested for an IRF4 rearrangement.	32239695	PubMed		Au-Yeung et al., 2020		3	accepted	12254	Somatic	2025-01-12 00:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12254	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5326	true
v::IRF4 Fusion	5326	Large B-cell Lymphoma With IRF4 Rearrangement		Intermediate young adult onset,Juvenile onset,Early young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this 2020 study the authors included twenty cases classified as IRF4 positive Large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL-IRF4). The patients were aged from 5 to 22 years (median of 14 years). All cases showed positivity by immunohistochemistry for MUM1 (protein encoded by IRF4) and BCL6. The rearrangement of IRF4 was confirmed by FISH for 17 cases and IGH involvement was detected in 7 cases. Through a targeted genome sequencing approach IRF4 and NF-κB-related genes (CARD11, CD79B, and MYD88) were found to be the most frequently mutated in LBCL-IRF4 cases. Copy number analysis by single-nucleotide polymorphism array platforms detected that LBCL-IRF4 cases had frequent 17p deletions and gains of chromosome 7 and 11q. Using a nanostring assay an overexpression of the downstream target genes of the NF-κB pathway were detected. The authors conclude that LBCL-IRF4 tumors have a distinct molecular profile.	31738823	PubMed		Ramis-Zaldivar et al., 2020		4	accepted	12255	Somatic	2025-01-12 00:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12255	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5326	true
v::JAK2 Fusion	2445	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650	Intermediate young adult onset,Early young adult onset,Childhood onset,Juvenile onset,Late young adult onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	JAK2 rerrangements were found to be one of genetic aberrations demonstrated in 15 cases of Ph-like ALL that were characterised using transcriptome and whole genome sequencing. As these are genetic alterations activating kinase or cytokine receptor signalling, these lesions could be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This paper documented the following JAK2 fusions: BCR::JAK2, STRN3::JAK2 and PAX5::JAK2. All JAK2 fusions identified in the study are in-frame and disrupt the pseudokinase domain of JAK2, which is thought to relieve autoinhibition of the kinase domain, resulting in a constitutively active fusion protein. The authors performed targeted analysis for these specific detected fusions in another 231 cases of high risk B-progenitor ALL from the COG AALL0232. They did not identify any othe cases with the same JAK2 fusions, however this does not rule out JAK2 fusions with other not targeted partners. JAK2 rearrangements were not identified in the MPN, CMML, and AML cohorts, and have not been detected in other childhood B-ALL subtypes studied by WGS and mRNA-seq, indicating they are highly enriched in Ph-like ALL. Flow cytometric phosphosignaling analysis on the cases with BCR::JAK2 and STRN3::JAK2 fusions demonstrated activation of downstream signaling pathways and tyrosine phosphorylation. This basal level of phosphorylation was then reduced with the JAK2 inhibitor XL019. Dasatinib was able to slightly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation in the JAK2 cases. A BCR::JAK2 rearranged xenograft model was also tested to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. There was a striking decrease in leukemic burden after 4 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment compared to vehicle-treated controls confirming the role of the BCR::JAK2 fusion as the key abnormality driving survival and proliferation of leukemia cells.	22897847	PubMed		Roberts et al., 2012		4	accepted	12256	Somatic	2025-01-09 00:57:11 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12256	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2445	false
RBM15::MRTFA Fusion	2985	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RBM15::MRTFA Fusion		Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset,Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this study, the authors investigated the association of the RBM15::MRTFA fusion with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL, FAB-M7), particularly in non-Down syndrome infants and young children. AMKL is a rare and heterogeneous aggresive disease that progresses rapidly, having a median patient survival of only eight months.The analysis focused on five patients, all infants and young children, diagnosed with AMKL carrying the t(1;22) translocation. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based positional cloning, the study defined the genomic breakpoints associated with the t(1;22) translocation. The researchers mapped breakpoints to a 28-kb intron on chromosome 22q13 and a 6-kb interval on chromosome 1p13. Subsequent analyses revealed a novel fusion gene, RBM15::MRTFA, resulting from the translocation. The RBM15::MRTFA fusion transcript encodes a chimeric protein that incorporates functional motifs from both genes, including RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) from RBM15 and the SAP domain from MRTFA, potentially driving leukemogenesis through deregulation of RNA processing and altered transcriptional activity. This study highlights the central pathogenic role of the RBM15::MRTFA fusion in AMKL and its diagnostic significance, drawing parallels with other fusion-driven leukemias such as PML::RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia. The findings emphasize the value of molecular diagnostics in identifying rare but critical genetic markers, underscoring the RBM15::MRTFA fusion as a key diagnostic and potentially therapeutic target in AMKL.	11431691	PubMed		Ma et al., 2001		4	accepted	12260	Somatic	2025-01-12 00:00:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12260	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2985	true
RBM15::MRTFA Fusion	2985	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RBM15::MRTFA Fusion		Childhood onset,Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	In this study, the authors explored the genomic landscape of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in patients without Down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL). AMKL is a rare and heterogeneous subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with poor outcomes. The analysis included 99 patients, comprising 75 pediatric cases (infants and children) and 24 adult cases, making it the largest cohort of non-DS-AMKL to undergo next-generation sequencing to date. Using RNA and exome sequencing, the study identified seven genomic subgroups in pediatric non-DS-AMKL, characterized by distinct chimeric oncogenes and cooperating mutations. Among these, the RBM15::MRTFA (also known as RBM15-MKL1) fusion was detected in 10.5% of pediatric cases. This fusion, resulting from the recurrent t(1;22) translocation, was predominantly observed in infants. The RBM15::MRTFA fusion encodes a chimeric protein that integrates functional motifs from both genes, leading to aberrant regulation of RNA processing, transcriptional activity, and megakaryoblast proliferation. The study emphasized the the clinical importance of stratifying non-DS-AMKL patients by genomic subtypes and underscored RBM15::MRTFA fusion and a defining oncogenic driver for one of the molecular subtypes of AMKL.	28112737	PubMed		de Rooij et al., 2017		4	accepted	12261	Somatic	2025-01-12 00:00:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12261	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2985	true
KRAS G12C	78	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Sotorasib,Panitumumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 3 trial, patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer harbouring KRAS G12C mutations were assigned to one of three groups. The first group received 960 mg of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) once daily plus panitumumab (n = 53), the second group received 240 mg of sotorasib once daily plus panitumumab (n=53), and the third group received investigator's choice of trifluridine-tipiracil or regorafenib/standard-care (n=54). The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.2-6.3) in the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab, 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.6-5.7) in the 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab, and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.9) in the standard care group. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death compared to the standard care cohort was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.30-0.78, p=0.005) in the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.37-0.95, p=0.036) in the 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group. The ORR was 26.4% (95% CI, 15.3 to 40.3), 5.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 15.7), and 0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 6.6) in the 960-mg sotorasib–panitumumab, 240-mg sotorasib–panitumumab, and standard-care groups, respectively. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse effects occurred in 35.8% of the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group, 30.2% of the 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group, and 43.1% in the standard care group. Overall, the study concluded that the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group resulted in a longer PFS compared to the standard treatment, and toxic effects were expected with limited discontinuation.	37870968	PubMed		Fakih et al., 2023	NCT05198934	4	accepted	12264	Somatic	2025-01-30 20:45:49 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12264	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/78	false
